1574,Speech Pathology Australia," this report would not have happened if it had not been for the particular work of speech pathology australia, who were so dedicated in working with and briefing the community affairs references committee on the issues that need to be looked at, and their dedication and concern for speech pathology services in australia. i bet you many australians just do not appreciate what speech pathology entails in this country and why it is so important. through the committee process it has become an extremely apparent that speech pathology and communication and language disorders are absolutely critical to people's life outcomes—absolutely critical. i see this report as probably the matching pair to the report that the committee did on hearing services in australia. our report on hearing services highlighted the impact hearing impairment as deafness has on people's life outcomes, as do a person's ability to communicate verbally. it is absolutely fundamental to a person's development and wellbeing. the committee report makes 10 recommendations. but before i start on outlining some of those recommendations and our findings, i want to make sure that i have time to acknowledge the work that speech pathology australia has put into this inquiry and thank the many professionals in the speech pathology area that we spoke to, parents, older people and people suffering from aphasia who contributed, making sure that we had full access to information. i also want to thank those people who hosted us on various site visits, and i will come to that in a minute. i also protect the want to point out the committee secretariat, who, as per usual and once again went above and beyond the call of duty. in particular, our secretary, janet radcliffe, and also richard grant, who have done us proud in the work they have produced from the wealth very good quality submissions that we received, from people's personal experiences, and from the hansard evidence—pulling out what were the main issues.

1634,The Financial Services Council, the member for robertson spoke of comments made by the financial services council. i would like to refer to another observation made by the financial services council. they had this to say:,3
600,Australian Republican Movement," as the member for wentworth pointed out earlier, neville wran was a founding member of the australian republican movement and a proud advocate for an australian becoming our head of state. he understood the value of one of us being appointed as our head of state and the value that that would bring to australian society and australia's future. he worked hard as a founding member of the australian republican movement and was a generous donor to the cause of an australian republic.",1
1445,Ports Australia, (1) notes that on thursday 6 august 2015 hutchison ports australia terminated 97 of its workers via text message and email late at night;,666
1262,Medicines Australia,"currently the pbs costs about $9 billion in the 2010-11 year and it is estimated that it will cost us $13 billion by 2018. so the taxpayer is the winner from the mou which has been agreed to with medicines australia, which represents over 50 companies. about 86 per cent of total annual pbs expenditure goes to companies which produce drugs through medicines australia. we are talking about nearly 60 per cent of sales of off-patent medicines as well. so i thank medicines australia for their willingness to ensure price certainty and the reductions that will benefit not just the taxpayers of australia but also the pensioners and concession card holders who really need access to the kinds of drugs that will make their lives better.",4
1010,Family First," (herbert) (12:04): i only met david francis jull on the one occasion, and that was in the last few months when david knew he was dying. the mark of the man was he sat there, shook my hand—and his grasp was firm—looked me in the eye and wished me well. my association with david jull goes back an awfully long time. when my family first moved to brisbane in 1974, jully was the sports reporter on channel 0 news. the beauty of those days in tv was that you did not have to be good-looking, which was very handy for jully. you could quite often see, in the corner of the tv, the smoke drifting up from the ashtray. david jull used to read the news with brian cahill, who was a teacher at gregory terrace—his daughter, in fact, works for the member for ryan here in parliament. the camera was supposed to come back to jully to do the sport but it came back to brian cahill, who was sucking on a black and white in full screen.",666
1334,National Farmers' Federation," this is the 25th anniversary of the landcare movement in australia and i congratulate all the landcare organisations around the country. it has been said that for every dollar put in by the government, $2.60 is put in by individuals and organisations locally and $12 of in-kind assistance is also given. the 25th anniversary of landcare's formation is something to be cherished and honoured. i congratulate the australian conservation foundation and the national farmers' federation for the longstanding support and the initiation of this organisation. they have been behind it from the word go. the chairman of landcare queensland, mr geoff penton, said:",4
310,Australian Diagnostic Imaging Association," when we learn about this gp tax, we learn more about the hidden costs of this gp tax—and the more we learn, the worse it gets. this will probably be useful for our prime minister if someone could send this transcript to him—he did not have a clue about diagnostic imaging today. medicare provides around 23 million diagnostic imaging and pathology services. the australian diagnostic imaging association estimates that the gp tax will reduce funding to these services by $188 million in 2015-16—it is a 10 per cent cut, prime minister—and rebates for general patients who were previously bulk-billed for pathology tests and imaging due to the abolition of the bulk-billing incentive from 1 july next year. the abolition of the greatest permissible gap safety net, a safety net which moderates the cost of high cost items, has gone too. ",3
1277,Mission Australia," today i would like to take some time to raise awareness of an issue that affects far too many young australians: the issue of negative body image. body image—and, more specifically, negative body image—is indiscriminate. it can affect individuals of any age, gender, size or ethnicity. a recent study by mission australia showed that body image is more of a concern for people aged 20 to 24, with 28.7 per cent indicating concern, than for those aged 15 to 19, with 27.4 per cent indicating concern. children aged between 11 and 14 are also worried about their body image, with 23.7 per cent indicating that it is of concern to them. that is an excellent point on this issue and i would encourage all parents to explain to their children that health should come before appearance and that a healthy lifestyle is much more important than a fashionable outward appearance. the fact that body image is an issue that concerns so many of our australian youth is reason enough for me to believe that it should concern not only me and others in this chamber but the community as a whole. these young people are the future of our nation. they are the individuals who will one day stand in this chamber, and i feel it is our responsibility to ensure they have the best possible start in life, not a start that includes self-doubt, self-dissatisfaction or uncertainty about their self-worth. at present, there is a conflicting message for young people about what a healthy body image is, and mission australia's manager of research, anne hampshire, summed this up well by stating:",3
1334,National Farmers' Federation, the national farmers' federation has said that it has deep concerns about the potential for this bill to be extended to agriculture in the future. in particular they say:,3
922,Cricket Australia,"appeal funds have been set up to help the people of christchurch. i know australians are going to be very generous in their support. in that regard, i warmly welcomed the news today from cricket australia that tomorrow's australia and new zealand world cup match will be broadcast live by channel 9, fox sports and abc grandstand. players from both teams will be showing their respect by wearing black armbands and having a moment's silence before the match. the earthquake appeal will be promoted and there will be ways for cricket lovers to donate as they watch that match.",1
1334,National Farmers' Federation," the ceo of the national farmers' federation, simon talbot, was also part of the mission. he warned that if this thing is delayed, let alone stopped, it will cost australian agriculture $300 million alone in 2016. he also said, 'many agricultural producers and supply chains are gearing up in preparedness for the agreement being ratified. it's the centrepiece of significant agricultural expansion in australia. we have only touched the tip of the iceberg in relation to the opportunity.'",3
1626,The Alannah and Madeline Foundation," i also draw the house's attention to the recent digital licence program established by the alannah and madeline foundation, with the support of google—another large digital technology platform. this esmart digital licence program will be made available to every grade 6 student in australia this year—almost 300,000 children—thanks to a grant of $1.2 million from google. as part of this digital licence program, children who undertake it will use quizzes, videos and games to teach them how to be smart, safe and responsible digital citizens—again, targeting intervention at the children rather than from above through regulation.",4
558,Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association," i also acknowledge the opportunity that has been afforded to the industry to provide input to the government's response to the montara commission of inquiry. from my discussions with industry—and they have been extensive—i understand this is an issue that they are very engaged in. they share the same aspirations to make sure the industry can develop in a safe and sustainable manner while preserving and not impacting on the environment. i applaud the commitment from the industry, as outlined by the minister, by which the australian petroleum production and exploration association, appea, and its members have worked to create. appea has created a draft mutual aid memorandum of understanding relating to incident response, a self-audit tool for the management of well operations, and an oil spill preparedness and response improvement plan.",4
926,CropLife Australia, australia's gross value of farm production is worth an estimated $47.9 billion a year with an export value of farm commodities of around $38 billion. the agvet chemicals industry is vital to quality food and fibre production and makes essential tools for primary producers. the crop protection industry body croplife australia estimates in a recent report that: ,3
1702,Women With Disabilities Australia," last year, christina was the only australian woman with a disability to attend the un committee on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women, in new york. christina represented women with disabilities australia, a group of committed, frighteningly intelligent and savvy women who have alerted me to the individual, systemic and societal discrimination suffered by many women with a disability—and some of their stories are chilling. in march this year, she was also a member of the official australian delegation to the un commission on the status of women.",1
1670,Urban Development Institute of Australia, urban development institute of australia and other urban advocates,666
287,Australian Council of Trade Unions,"as the shadow minister for regional development, i live in regional australia and have done so for more than three decades. as the shadow minister for tourism, i have had skin in the game as a tourism operator in the water sports industry. both the labor ministers i shadow—the minister for resources and energy and minister for tourism and the minister for regional australia, regional development and local government—have no such real connection with their portfolios. in fact, they share the same qualification coming into this place both having been presidents of the australian council of trade unions and living in metropolitan melbourne. the minister for resources and energy and minister for tourism discharges his duties in that order and is widely known as the minister for the mining tax. but he got his training wheels by taxing the tourism industry.",1
947,Defence Force Welfare Association," (fraser) (20:21): the indexation of military pensions and superannuation is an issue that, as the member for fraser, i am very familiar with. over at least the last year i have been working with colleagues senator kate lundy, mike kelly, the federal member for eden-monaro and gai brodtmann, the member for canberra, along with the defence force welfare association, the superannuated commonwealth officers association and the australian council of public sector retiree organisations, in making representations regarding the indexation of military superannuation pensions as well as those for commonwealth employees.",4
1062,Friends of the Earth," she is a veteran environmental activist from friends of the earth in victoria; she was on their management committee. in 2012, she was part of climate action moreland, which campaigned to shut down the hazelwood coal-fired power station in victoria's latrobe valley. in 2010, she was spokeswoman for the camp for climate action protest, which saw two protesters chain themselves by their necks to the hunter valley conveyer belt carrying coal to the bayswater power station north-west of sydney. at the time of that action, ellen roberts said:",1
1543,Settlement Council of Australia," (ii) the booklet was developed in consultation with the refugee resettlement advisory council, the settlement council of australia, the refugee council of australia and the multicultural youth advocacy network. comments and input were provided in may and june 2012.",4
316,Australian Drug Foundation," the australian drug foundation reports that new psychoactive substances are being developed around the world at an unprecedented rate. while there is little in australian data showing usage of these drugs, statistics from the united kingdom indicate that these drugs are increasingly causing harm with 52 deaths being directly attributed to new psychoactive substances in 2012—an increase from 25 in 2008 and six in 2003. alarmingly, the same data from the united kingdom found that in 2013 approximately 230,000 people aged 14 and older admitted to using synthetic cannabis. ",3
1684,Water Services Association of Australia," beyond the national irrigators' council and the national farmers' federation—two incredibly important players, i acknowledge that, in the process of water reform—every other stakeholder, as far as i can tell, is opposed to this bill. the two other significant peak bodies—the australian water association and the water services association of australia—indicated quite strongly their opposition to the abolition of the national water commission. the water services association of australia in its evidence to the senate inquiry around this bill said of the abolition that it:",3
1640,The Pharmacy Guild of Australia,"the bill sets out, as the minister has pointed out, that we think there will be an average price reduction of at least 23 per cent, to be achieved across all brands in the cycle. what that means is there will be a very large saving in the pbs and we think this will be market driven. the minister has pointed out, in a report to parliament on the 2007 pbs changes that the member for bowman talked about, that consumers will benefit. she says that somewhere around $700 million will be saved over 10 years. that is roads, schools and health care. that is community infrastructure which can be used in communities across regional and rural australia and in my electorate of blair in south-east queensland. we think that this legislation is a better deal for taxpayers and we think it is a better deal for consumers we think it is a better deal for pensioners and a better deal for non concessional card holders. we think it will mean that the market will play a role in reducing the cost of medicines for people. we also think that the pharmaceutical industry will play a role, as will the pharmacy guild of australia, in achieving better outcomes for taxpayers and consumers.",4
245,Australian Christian Lobby," i have to reserve some of my criticism for the government. in this country we have, for example, joe de bruyn, a unionist and an influential member of the labor party, who spoke recently at the australian christian lobby conference, a few weeks before the labor conference. he said: we recently had a contribution to this debate by jim wallace from the australian christian lobby and archbishop jensen, who said recently that being gay is more dangerous than smoking. in one sense he is right, because discrimination is dangerous, because prejudice is dangerous. by his logic, being aboriginal is more dangerous than smoking. the health impacts that are associated with people's sexuality are a consequence of discrimination and stigma. they have nothing at all to do with the choices that people make. we know, for example, that if you are same-sex attracted you are more likely to smoke, more likely to have had a chronic condition, much more likely to have experienced high levels of psychological distress, more likely to have had suicidal thoughts and plans, and more likely to have attempted suicide. those statistics, as shocking as they are, have nothing to do with being gay and everything to do with the social prejudice, discrimination and violence that is perpetrated against lesbians, gay men and bisexual people.",1
1008,Family Business Australia," the agencies represented on the inter-departmental committee should periodically consult with key stakeholder groups to seek their input and feedback on the issues it is discussing. these groups should include family business australia, the australian chamber of commerce and industry, the council of small business of australia and the national farmers the committee recommends that the australian securities and investments commission consult with family businesses to gauge their understanding of the corporations act 2001, in particular directors' duties and liabilities, and work with family business australia and other interested organisations that represent family businesses to disseminate information through education and training. information could also be usefully provided in plain terms on the moneysmart website. the australian securities and investments commission (asic) is committed to engaging with family business australia to identify the most appropriate means of tailoring communication and engagement with family business australia's members. family business australia is currently a member of asic's business advisory committee. this forum provides a mechanism for the organisation to provide direct feedback to asic in respect of registration and corporate register functions.",4
817,Catholic Social Services," there are approximately 600,000 charitable entities in the not-for-profit sector, and all members of this parliament would agree that these play an integral role in our communities. as i have already said, they provide vital services and fill service gaps on a daily basis. i would like to mention just a few such organisations that operate across the nation and in my community: anglicare, the australian conservation foundation, catholic social services australia, unitingcare, the red cross, mission australia, the salvation army, surf life saving australia, the rspca, world vision and relay for life. locally, we have nova employment at richmond and springwood, blue mountains cancer help, hawkesbury community kitchen, the blue mountains world heritage institute, slow food blue mountains, salvation army clothing stores and one adtc. these are only a few of the organisations that deliver face-to-face, grassroots assistance to our local communities.",4
1544,Sexual Health and Family Planning Australia," for over 30 years, sexual health and family planning australia, sh & fpa, have been meeting the needs of australians by providing advocacy, education and training around the issues of sexual health, family planning and cancer prevention through pap smears, vaccinations and information on contraception. in my own state—and yours, mr president—family planning queensland, a member organisation of sexual health and family planning australia, is working to bring sexual education and family planning services to all queenslanders regardless of their geographical location, age, ability level, social disadvantage or ethnic group. in fact, their work concentrates on people who often have other forms of disadvantage. they have a range of programs particularly looking at people who have need in the migrant communities and aboriginal and islander communities across the state. some of their work on bringing people into the wider community has been acknowledged, and they have won awards for their efforts. recognising the contribution and benefits that this technology could bring to the sexual and reproductive health field, a partnership between sexual health and family planning australia and flinders university was established. the flinders filters researchers working in this specialist area of search filter development have worked with sexual health and family planning australia to produce a pilot of three search filters on one key issue in sexual and reproductive health, and that is the area of contraception. the three specific search filters look at a general, all-inclusive contraception; long-acting, reversible contraception, commonly referred to as larc; and emergency contraception. they have been generously made available for use by the community on the flinders university website. they provide an example of how the evidence could be captured to inform practice, policy and planning in this field. it is important that we acknowledge the work that has been done by sexual health and family planning australia and flinders university in working on this initiative. one of the core issues, of course, is the ongoing future and the effect of funding in this area. we know that across many of our state governments reductions in funding have occurred for sexual and reproductive health areas. that will have an impact on the services that can be provided to the people who need it most.",4
910,Cotton Australia," but let us put that 16 gigalitres in perspective. cotton australia have said on their website that 16 gigalitres of water is about what is required to irrigate about 3,000 hectares of cotton per year. so let us run through those figures: 880 gigalitres a year was the recharge, last year—in a very good year with heavy rainfalls. and it does not immediately becomes available; it might be a thousand years before that water actually becomes available, because it just re-pressurises these great formations. the estimated total use, other than for the mining sector, was 650 gigalitres a year. and the coal seam methane gas industry extracted 16 gigalitres. that is the equivalent, according to cotton australia, of the amount of water that is used to irrigate some 3,000 hectares of cotton.",3
1455,Private Healthcare Australia," i remind the senate that organisations like private healthcare australia have consistently warned that labor's legislative changes to the private health insurance rebate will increase premiums for all australians and force people onto the public hospital lists. changes to the private health insurance rebate will hurt those australians who need it most. i will reiterate the figures: 3.4 million people with private health insurance live in households with incomes less than $35,000 per annum and 5.6 million people with private health insurance cover reside in households that have a gross annual income of below $50,000. for the 12.5 million australians with private health insurance, this will no doubt have a major impact.",3
1334,National Farmers' Federation," why create an extra oversight body when you can look at the empirical data flowing out of the last six years? labor was in power. we changed the work choices legislation. what happened? did disputes increase? there was no mention, by the member for sturt, of the fact that dispute days went down. what about productivity? did productivity go down in the last six years in the building industry? surely, with labor in control, and bringing in this legislation, productivity went down. no, it increased. i am loath to make this connection but let us look at fatalities, the most horrible piece of empirical data in workplace relations. did fatalities increase or decrease? they decreased under our legislation. so why bring in extra red tape and extra costs? it can only be because of a political agenda. this is 'union busting 101'—create red tape for unions. i do recognise that it also creates red tape for employer organisations, but they are a little bit more muzzled in terms of speaking up. those opposite think the national farmers federation is like a union; it is not. there are a range of unions out there and a range of employer organisations.",1
1407,Ovarian Cancer Australia," the symptoms are seemingly innocuous, so the ovarian cancer campaign is all about k.i.s.s. with ovarian cancer, that certainly does not stand for 'keep it simple stupid'; it stands for 'know the important symptoms and signs'. these include abdominal or pelvic pain, increased abdominal size or persistent abdominal bloating, needing to urinate often or urgently and difficulty eating or feeling full quickly. many of these symptoms are experienced by many of us from time to time, but ovarian cancer australia have produced a symptoms diary in which they encourage women to write down their symptoms if they are concerned that they are experiencing many of these symptoms on a regular basis and then to take the diary to their medical practitioner.",4
815,Catholic Health Australia, catholic health australia said:,3
1324,National Council of Women of Australia," (canberra) (11:31): there is a deep disillusionment among many parts of the australian community at the moment that currently wishes a pox on all our houses. recently, i attended the triennial conference of the national council of women of australia and was presented with a petition calling for:",3
23,Aftercare,"(10989) treatment of a person's wound (other than normal aftercare) provided by a registered aboriginal health worker if: (a) the treatment is provided on behalf of, and under the supervision of, a medical practitioner; and (b) the person is not an admitted patient of a hospital. this item has been in use from 2006.05.01 to the present. (10996) treatment of a person's wound (other than normal aftercare) provided by a practice nurse if: (a) the treatment is provided on behalf of, and under the supervision of, a medical practitioner: and (b) the person is not an admitted patient of a hospital. this item has been in use from 2004.02.01 to the present.",666
1437,Police Federation of Australia,"i strongly believe it is necessary for measures to be included in this bill to ensure that part of the spectrum will be made available to police and emergency services in times of emergency. the peak bodies of australia's police, firefighting, ambulance and other emergency services have requested 20 megahertz of the spectrum to be reserved for these disaster situations. the use of this spectrum represents some amazing opportunities for frontline emergency services and could revolutionise the way these services operate. mr deputy speaker, i bring to your attention a fact sheet that was sent to all mps and senators by the police federation of australia. in this fact sheet they have raised a number of concerns and made comments in relation to reserving part of this spectrum for emergency services personnel. this updates our february alert that the police and emergency services need the spectrum in the 700-megahertz band for digital dividend for public safety. i will read some quotes from the fact sheet: the police federation of australia are surely an agency that we should all be listening to. this is an issue of national significance, and i hope the minister is listening. we can only assume that the sale of the digital dividend is being used for promotional purposes, probably to try to return the budget to surplus in 2012-13.",3
24,Aged and Community Services Australia," professor john kelly, the chief executive of aged and community services australia, has said that the withdrawal of this funding, ignored the problems faced by staff and patients. he said:",3
473,Australian Livestock and Rural Transporters' Association," yes, $400,000-plus. the sheer arrogance of the tribunal—i spoke to senator sterle at the back of the chamber and i said: 'this order that comes in on 4 april must be delayed. people don't understand it; they don't know the ramifications; people are going to go broke; people are going to lose their jobs. they will probably lose their houses because their houses are mortgaged to buy their rigs.' we put an application in, thanks to senator cash, aig, natroad, the australian livestock and rural transporters association et cetera, to have this delayed.",4
1542,Service to Youth Council," (adelaide) (13:54): i rise to draw to the attention of the house a wonderful program that is delivered to young people across adelaide through the service to youth council—that is, the youth connections program. this is a program that is delivered across australia. it is aimed towards young people who have become disengaged from schooling and are at risk of falling through the cracks and slipping into youth unemployment. this is a program that, up to the end of last year, helped almost 75,000 young people across australia get a hand up, and the estimates are that by the end of this year that number will reach 100,000.",4
1222,Lebanese Muslim Association," another area of the budget where savings measures could be applied to instead of taking entitlements away from our sick, elderly and young is the liberal and national parties' infrastructure budget. according to treasury briefings, over the next two years, 2015-16 and 2016-17, this government plans to spend approximately $7 billion on top of the just over $6 billion that is spent annually on infrastructure the majority of this money will be spent on mainland capital cities roads—especially in sydney and melbourne. this government has made plans to spend billions of extra dollars on infrastructure in sydney and melbourne in the lead up to the next federal general election. the infrastructure budget graphs supplied by treasury do not lie. they show that while mr abbott and mr hockey are telling tasmanians to tighten their belts the residents of western sydney and melbourne are enjoying a huge boost to the amount of federal funds which are being showered on them. if regional australia and ordinary tasmanians are to tighten their belts then why can't the belt tightening be carried out by the people of sydney and melbourne as well? for example, why has the liberal government promised to provide $20 million over three years to the lebanese muslim association and other arabic-speaking people to build residential aged-care services that will provide 'culturally appropriate aged care in western sydney' when the budget shows that over the forward estimates savings of $12.7 million and $38.8 million respectively, $51.76 million in total, will be achieved by targeting our very own veterans who receive incapacity payments and disability pensions? i have never worked out how any government can describe as budget savings taking money and entitlements away from those citizens—our defence force veterans—who were prepared to lay their lives on the line.",4
811,Carers Alliance," one of the great things we have heard the government taking credit for is the delivery of the national disability insurance scheme. i think it is worth noting what the carers alliance have said about the national disability insurance scheme announced in the budget. if anyone knows about the difficulty of caring and what we need under a national disability insurance scheme, the carers alliance are first and foremost. i quote from their press release: they are the words of the carers alliance. then we look at issues where this government has actually cut spending. we see that our defence budget has been reduced in real terms this year by 10.5 per cent. that is the largest year-on-year reduction since the end of the korean war. as a result, our national defence spending as a percentage of gdp will now fall to 1.56 per cent, the lowest we have had since 1938. the only thing we had missing in this announcement was the prime minister standing up and declaring 'peace in our time'. as babbage smith, the government adviser and author of the 2009 defence white paper, said about these cuts, 'we're going to be in real trouble for at least 20 years. we won't have the ability to defend ourselves.'",3
881,Community Housing Federation of Australia," thirdly, the committee consistently heard that we need a national affordable housing plan. we heard this from right across the sector: from academics and researchers; from housing peak bodies like national shelter, the community housing federation of australia and homelessness australia; from acoss; and from local governments, but also from the development sector—from the udia and mba, to name just two. the city futures research centre's submission detailed the attributes of a good national plan, and i commend their submission to the senate; we quoted from it extensively in the report. the report also says: in december last year, the government terminated the housing and homelessness program in the department of social services from june 2015. this resulted in the withdrawal of funding to national shelter, to the community housing federation of australia and to homelessness australia, and a change to the funding arrangements for the australian housing and urban research institute, ahuri. i want to record my concern about the evidence from the department that was vague about the reasons that decision was taken. one can only come to the conclusion that the decision taken was a political one.",4
102,Asthma Australia, (2) congratulates asthma australia for its work promoting national asthma week and raising community awareness of asthma.,4
1665,United Voice," (victoria—parliamentary secretary for school education and workplace relations) (18:36): perhaps i should start by going back to some of the earlier comments by senator nash and come to that final question in a moment. childcare funding is not a cash cow. i am astounded that she would even use an expression such as that when we are dealing with affordability and cost-of-living pressures being faced by families. what this measure seeks to do, as has been covered on many other occasions, is reconfigure existing funding to help ensure that the quality of child care available to families is improved. certainly this measure does involve saving measures. this measure was government policy at the last election and the minister spoke at several community childcare forums during the election period with parents and childcare workers about the changes. this proposed measure was contained in the 2010-11 budget papers. the minister meets regularly with representatives of the childcare sector including the childcare alliance, the australian early childhood association, family day care australia and united voice. all of the sector has been committed to the national quality framework. indeed, these measures have been discussed and consulted on during countless forums relevant to the national quality framework.",4
876,Community and Public Sector Union,"it is this sense of obligation and purpose that has governed the decisions i have made in pursuing the work that i have done. if i am known by others in this place it would be through my role as the national secretary of the community and public sector union, an organisation i worked for for over 16 years and of which i am a proud life member. i have had the great privilege of being a delegate, an organiser, a lawyer and an official of the community and public sector union. in that time i undertook many hard-fought campaigns against some formidable and well-resourced opponents, many of them who sit in this place. i cannot speak more highly of the men and women who are members of the cpsu. they work in government departments and agencies, in the telecommunications and broadcasting industries. they are as committed to the performance of the public services they deliver as they are to their union. they have stuck by their union when it was not only unfashionable to do so but when in many cases it was a job-jeopardising move. to the hundreds of cpsu men and women who lost their jobs over the last decade for little other reason than that they were a union representative, i honour your commitment, and i will do my bit here to ensure that this country never again recedes into the industrial bigotry which made that possible. i am grateful for the great support from my union—the community and public sector union. i have seen many members and officials and former officials in the audience. i am so proud to be here today to talk of your cause and your issues, and i will represent your interests to the best of my ability where i can in this place. to the cfmeu miners division, bobby timbs and spotty white, who took time from dealing with their own problems to assist me in my campaign, and to the mua's gary 'hollywood' keane, the awu's andy gillespie and wayne phillips: thank you very much, as well as to all of the other unions on the south coast who assisted me. on the south coast it is sometimes hard to separate people who wear a union hat from those who wear another hat, but i thank narelle clay, richard 'makie' davis, colin and melissa markham and many, many others.",1

1510,Royal Australian College of General Practitioners," the royal australian college of general practitioners warn that the provisions of this bill 'hold long-term threats to harm the current high standard of medical services, and consequently health services, delivered to the community'—very worrying—and that these provisions could drive health management to be focused on performance and cost cutting more than patient care. they had concerns about virtually every aspect of the bill. they warned of significant overlap between this new bureaucracy and the existing australian commission on safety and quality in health care. so, not only are we getting extra bureaucracy, we are once again getting extra regulation. real reform would cut the number of bureaucrats needed to administer the system. real reform would cut the regulatory burden on our hospitals, both public and private. we do not see that with this bill.",3
1254,Medecins Sans Frontieres," today the united kingdom is hosting a pledging conference to get countries and international donors to pledge beds, medical staff and money to help tackle ebola in sierra leone. as late as yesterday, australia were not able to confirm whether we would be represented and what we would be pledging, so i am very pleased to hear about the extra $10 million today. as many health experts have said, the spread of ebola is preventable, and health workers can be very well protected with the right infection control techniques. our infection control techniques are indeed second to none. medecins sans frontieres say our capability is unique. if we fail to act now, the consequences will only grow in seriousness. the executive director of medecins sans frontieres in australia, paul mcphun, says he wonders why the foreign minister will not, at the very least, pledge to send australian volunteers to the region as soon as medivac agreements are reached with partner countries. msf is the largest ngo working in west africa. mr mcphun said:",3
1662,United Firefighters Union of Australia," (kennedy) (11:02): i want to pay tribute to the united firefighters union of australia. unionism is something that seems to be maligned almost continuously in the media throughout australia, and i am sure that the corporate owners of the media think it is a good idea to have no unions so they do not have to pay anyone very much money. in this case, i was a very reluctant starter. staff had to sit me down and bang me on the head with the statistics. the firefighters union put forward a very professionally prepared brief and they had unassailable statistics. clearly the incidence of cancer in firefighters was way out of proportion with that of the rest of the population. we know, of course, that certain chemicals are carcinogenic and breathing them can lead to cancer—as i have said many times in this house in relation to exhaust fumes from motorcars.",3
1225,Lesbians," the debate on same-sex marriage has been a complex and controversial one. it is complex because, i would hope, as a community we want to continue to encourage the acceptance and contribution of gay and lesbian australians in our community. it is complex because we want to end the trauma and isolation that is all too often felt by gays and lesbians as they negotiate the heart-wrenching pathway towards authenticity and acceptance of their sexuality, a process of sexual identity and acceptance that can be as painful and traumatic for the families of gay and lesbian australians as it can be for the people themselves. the matter is also controversial. it is controversial because some in the debate, most notably the australian greens, want to suggest they know best the minds of the australian electorate, better than anyone else in this place, perhaps even better than the members of the electorate themselves. it has been controversial also because many have confused the religious institution of marriage with marriage as a civil institution. it is marriage as a civil institution that should demand the primary concentration and deliberations of parliamentarians. i believe any future deliberation by the parliament on matters regarding the legal treatment of same-sex couples should make as its focus the task of creating a starker distinction between marriage as a civil institution and its role for some as a religious institution. i want to acknowledge those who come to this debate in a similar context to me, but who have arrived at a different conclusion. i have listened to their contribution, admired the strength of their convictions and i applaud their courage. by not agreeing to same-sex marriage, i am not choosing to endorse discrimination against my fellow gay and lesbians australians or to be disrespectful to their domestic relationships, or to lessen the value of their commitments, companionship, love and unions. instead, for me, it is an honest acknowledgement, of the special and unique characteristics of the union described as 'marriage'.",666
735,AUSVEG," (victoria) (14:39): my question is to the minister representing the minister for climate change and energy efficiency, senator wong. i refer the minister to the fact that the carbon tax has caused an almost threefold increase in the cost of refrigerant gases for farmers, small businesses and australian households. ausveg, who represent australian fruit and vegetable growers, have said that the cost of the most common refrigerant, r134a, will increase from $65.72 per kilo to $181.82 per kilo. the r404a refrigerant used by vegetable growers will increase from $92.80 per kilo to $377.71 per kilo. given that australian farmers are already facing difficult circumstances—rising costs, the high australian dollar and skill shortages—why is the australian government insistent on making a bad situation worse and forcing up the cost of producing australia's fruit and vegetables by imposing the world's biggest carbon tax?",3

1368,National Tertiary Education Union," i will take that interjection, senator brandis. i stand here as a very proud trade union official, having worked for the national tertiary education union and the australian education union for a number of years and having been a very proud and active member of my original union, which is the teachers union. there is a reason people belong to a trade union and need to belong to a trade union—because their rights at work need to be protected from the likes of the people opposite us, who want to have a debate about the trade union movement in this country because it assists their purposes to always attack workers' rights, to always attack the benefits people enjoy in their workplace, to drive their wages down, to drive the conditions of employment down, to make the places in which they work unsafe, to make the profits bigger and to make the outcomes for the workers much cheaper. of course they do not like the trade union movement because we are there and will continue to be there to defend the rights of workers to get a decent day's pay for a decent day's work and to do it in an environment that is safe.",1
105,Athletics Australia," (lyne) (19:37): i am honoured to speak about a man i never met but a man i wish i had met. as the only white man ever invited to the martin luther king games and with his own day on the us track calendar, it is certainly time we gave much greater recognition in australia to peter norman as a man, an athlete and as a believer in the universal principle of equality. in preparation for this motion, i very much enjoyed reading a lot about peter norman and talking with family and friends. i note statements this week from the australian olympic committee and athletics australia, and i particularly mention welcome contact from peter's brother, laurie, and his coach and the manager of the athletics team, ray weinberg. i also note the attendance today of peter's mother and sister, showing us all that this matters to the norman family—mostly i hope with pride, but maybe with a little pain following the events of 44 years ago and the journey that peter went through until his untimely death six years ago.",1

1311,National Asthma Council Australia," tonight i want to talk about the two organisations in this country that exist to support people with asthma and their carers. the first, asthma australia, is made up of the eight state and territory asthma foundations and it focuses on consumers. i am on the committee of the northern territory asthma foundation and asthma australia. the second, the national asthma council australia, focuses on primary healthcare professionals. both of these organisations currently receive funding from the australian government by way of the asthma management program, but that will finish in june of this year. asthma australia and the national asthma council australia, are both successful and far-reaching programs. they inform and alert people with asthma, and they keep the professionals up to date with information about evidence-based treatments for asthma. the work of these two national organisations has resulted in improved outcomes for people with asthma, and this has been achieved by supporting and promoting safe self-management. asthma became a national health priority in august 1999. that meant that the two organisations received some very serious funding for the first time, in 2001, and they are currently funded under the asthma management program. the asthma management program benefits the two asthma organisations through community support programs such as the asthma child and adolescent program. the national asthma council australia is funded for the gp and allied health asthma and respiratory education program—and let me tell you, there are still some gps out there who need to know what an asthma management plan is and why it is relevant—and for the production and dissemination of health information resources for health professionals. we know that both of these programs are performing well, as they have indicated in their respective evaluation processes.",4
392,Australian Honey Bee Industry Council," we had information from the department through minister joyce that the stakeholders consulted included dfat, because of its position in terms of developing trade agreements; the australian meat industry council, which, as i have said, is a particular area of interest for me, though i do put on record again that i am the vegetarian in the family; and the fruit juice council and the australian honey bee industry council, which are probably areas that i would understand better in terms of my own particular taste. in terms of the consultation process, it is most important, as i have said, that it included the australian meat industry council and also australian pork limited—again, an important area in our economy at the moment and one that has had significantly tough times in the past. the pork industry have faced significantly difficult times in the recent past not just because of climate conditions but also because of imports and their ability to get reward for their product. it is important that they were involved in this consultation as well as the chicken meat federation. so for all these groups with all their particular needs and particular interests, the government has absolutely committed that there has been full consultation with them and that they favour the approach put forward in the legislation before the chamber.",4

1003,Export Council of Australia," today's bill is so important to australian export businesses because its implementation will ultimately increase australia's reputation and competitiveness on the international stage. a recent survey of australian export businesses by the export council of australia revealed that the majority of difficulties experienced by exporters were regulatory compliance and access to finance respectively. as smaller companies rely more on international revenue from developed and emerging markets, increased or difficult bureaucracies would simply render them unfeasible. the survey further revealed that the majority of businesses, regardless of size, engage in a variety of business operations not limited to outsourcing, foreign investment, production and research and development. australian exports amounted to over $310 billion in recent years. this demonstrates the potential of australian businesses and, more importantly, how much more potential there is with the right policies in place. ",3
1306,National Association of Retail Grocers of Australia," more specifically, with respect to the amendment before us, i think there is a real problem here. i think there is a real problem for small business in particular. i think there is a problem for microbusiness. about 82 per cent of small businesses in australia are microbusinesses—that is, five or fewer people in the business. i was formerly a member of the federal government's micro­business consultative committee, appointed by peter reith, prior to my time in the senate. i established, owned and oper­ated my own small business and employed some 15 people, based in hobart and canberra, so i know what it is like. i was also an advocate for various small businesses and various small business organisations, including the tasmanian independent retailers, the national association of retail grocers of australia and a range of other business groups. in particular, i tried to advocate for small businesses. so, in this regard, let me just say: they are being dudded. if this bill goes ahead in its current form, you will find that small business will be impacted. the men, women and families behind those small businesses who have their necks on the line, will be impacted, because the bill in its current form has unintended consequences.

1668,Universities Australia," (1) the department of sustainability, environment, water, population and communities (dsewpac) and the department of education, employment and workplace relations (deewr) do not collect data on student accommodation and reliable figures are difficult to obtain. a 2010 survey by universities australia found that 34 of australia's 39 universities formally provide accommodation for students and that universities provide a total of 42,620 beds.",3
1334,National Farmers' Federation," the president of the australian national farmers federation, brent finlay, said the peak farm body is relieved that politics have been put aside in the interests of australia's economic future. he went on to say, 'this agreement is a game-changer for australian agriculture.' with that backdrop, in central queensland we can look forward to tariffs being eliminated on barley and sorghum. beef exports tariffs of 12 to 25 per cent will be totally eliminated over the next nine years. dairy tariffs up to 20 per cent will be eliminated in four to 11 years. there will be rapid tariff reductions on seafood, sheep meat, pork and horticulture, including macadamia nuts. it is certainly good news for my electorate, especially primary producers in the central highlands and the citrus growers in north burnett and wallaville.",3

1462,Property Council of Australia," despite the government's own vacillation undermining investor confidence, the property council of australia has indicated that the only hope australia has for maintaining its reputation as a safe place to invest is for the parliament to firm its resolve and reject this bill. independents cannot walk away from their responsibilities to regional tourism on the basis of an exaggerated regional assistance package, for this small amount of money will be spent in a meaningful way. it is vital to achieve the right mix of demand driver and supporting infrastructure allocations. examples of demand drivers might be the tasmanian parks and wildlife service's three capes track, or the redevelopment of the tasmanian museum and art gallery. supporting infrastructure is the transport and accommodation you would use when going to see a tourist attraction, like the spirit of tasmania, or the old woolstore apartment hotel—something i thought the member for bandt might be interested in. however, the money is allocated, independents should demand accountability, planning, and an outcomes focus. as i write this, i think of the clump point marina and the jetty at dunk island—still in a state of disrepair 18 months after cyclone yasi, despite our prime minister approving money to fix this infrastructure.",3
416,Australian Institute of Company Directors,"i would like to draw the house's attention to the comments of the former minister for finance and deregulation, lindsay tanner, from his speech to the australian institute of company directors' public sector governance conference on 14 october last year. he said:",1

1417,Parkinson's Australia,"amongst his considerable achievements for his cause, rod became president of parkinson's nsw. he initiated a priorities seminar as well as the access economics study now used by the european union and canada. he initiated lobbying for regional neurological nurses for the eastern states as well as an important community service statement raising awareness of parkinson's. as a result of those efforts, gilmore has its first dedicated nurse as part of a pilot program. he suggested the governor-general be patron. he became the vice-president of parkinson's australia, lobbying hard with the australian institute of health and welfare on discrepancies in statistical data.",1
1326,National Council on Intellectual Disability," australia ranks just 21 out of 29 oecd countries for employment participation for people with a disability. this is not good enough. through record investment in supporting job seekers with disability, and by pursuing important reforms - such as uncapping services and conducting an open tender for des -the government is working to improve employment outcomes for australians with disability. the decision to put des to a competitive tender has been welcomed by disability advocates, including the australian federation of disability organisations and the national council on intellectual disability.",3
511,Australian Mobile Telecommunications Association,"the government announced back in may its approach to the reissue of 15-year radio frequency spectrum licences. they highlighted that they would be going through a consultation phase and it has, along with the committee inquiry into this legislation, elicited some comments about the bill before us. the australian mobile telecommunications association in a discussion paper have expressed some concern about aspects of the coexistence of class and spectrum licences. they highlighted that amta does not support any amendment, terms and conditions of reissued spectrum licences that would permit other users encroaching on the licensed spectrum assets held by their members. they highlight that their members invest very significant capital for the exclusive but highly competitive use of licensed spectrum and permitting other users to access that spectrum has the potential to dilute the value of these assets particularly where users could be granted access at no cost. they said that if future coexistent use grows in such a way that was never originally envisaged or modelled, no-one could guarantee that it would not adversely impact on the primary spectrum license holders. there is no simple mechanism to measure, manage or rectify adverse outcomes of coexistent use and, if adverse impact occurred, the business impact on the primary licence holder could be significant and long-lasting.",3

437,Australian Institute of Petroleum," the changes in domestic refining capacity to date will not impact on australia meeting its liquid fuel requirements. there are reliable, mature and highly diversified international fuel supply chains which provide australia with economic security. the australian institute of petroleum and refiners were confident about the reliability of australia's supply chains and infrastructure to continue to meet local fuel demands, as it has done over many decades.",3
1334,National Farmers' Federation," this will lead to simple reforms to our system of chemical registration and has been supported by key industry groups such as new south wales farmers and agforce queensland as well as the national farmers federation. in a letter to the senate standing committee on rural and regional affairs and transport, matt linnegar, ceo of national farmers federation wrote: the assessment of the registration process should be a transparent, efficient and effective process to reduce the cost burden on farmers to assess agvet chemicals. it should also shorten registration and reconsideration response and time frames. the national farmers federation commends the government on their commitment to this process and would support passage of the agriculture and veterinary chemicals legislation through the parliament. it is worth noting that the national farmers federation were vocal opponents of the previous government's plan to implement a mandatory re-registration process, duplicating chemical review processes and delivering an unnecessarily regulatory burden on the agriculture sector. therefore, it comes as no surprise that the national farmers federation has welcomed the abbott government's commitment to remove this unnecessary process as well as to reduce the red tape and handbrake currently on the sector. benefits to virbac as a local business and employer include that the proposal to streamline changes to registered products will add flexibility to the operation at virbac's penrith plant, plus increase its efficiency and viability. this, in turn, can create opportunities to develop new products for livestock industries and potential new employment opportunities within virbac. removal of the registration scheme will enable virbac to direct more of its resources to the development of new products at penrith, providing an opportunity for expansion of the facilities and the employment of more staff. as you can see, mr deputy speaker, the passing of the bill will have an overwhelming benefit. it is welcomed by the national farmers federation and also at a local level, where businesses in my electorate, like virbac, will be able to see immediate benefits of the passing of this legislation.",3
24,Aged and Community Services Australia, (petrie) (22:24): i rise to speak about aged care and recent activities and events in my electorate. i was recently invited to spend a day at one of the aged-care facilities in my electorate and then attend the aged and community services australia national conference on the gold coast to talk about my experience of having spent that day at the local facility. i had the great pleasure of going to blue care's azure blue aged-care and residential living facility at redcliffe and spending time in their new wound clinic.,1
805,Cancer Council Australia,"other groups opposed to the granting of gene patents include the cancer council australia, the breast cancer foundation of australia, the royal australian college of pathologists, the human genetics society of australia and the australian medical association; and i acknowledge the presence in the gallery tonight of dr luigi palombi, who has dedicated much of his professional life and his passion to this issue. since lodging my notice of motion about this issue a couple of weeks ago, i have been inundated with emails from around the country sent by people who cannot believe that we would permit genetic material to be controlled by patent. one of those emails was from a doctor at westmead hospital who each year cares for over 500 new families with a genetic history of breast and other cancers. on 30 september, cancer council australia and the clinical oncological society of australia issued a press release welcoming my notice of motion. as i noted on 22 june 2009 in my last parliamentary speech on this issue, in 2008 a melbourne company, genetic technologies, ordered australian hospitals and clinical laboratories to stop testing for breast cancer, claiming it had the exclusive right to control access to the relevant gene under the licence it had obtained from us company myriad genetics. professor ian frazer, inventor of the cervical cancer vaccine, president of cancer council australia and former australian of the year, has said:",3

1130,History Teachers' Association of Australia," in the time left available to me, i would like to share with you the fact that yesterday i met here at parliament house both the northern territory winner and runner-up of the simpson prize. as you know, mr deputy speaker, this prize is a national competition, conducted by the history teachers association of australia, together with state and territory affiliates, for years 9 and 10 students on behalf of the australian government. the competition celebrates the anzac tradition. students are asked to write an essay or give a statement on their thinking of the anzacs. tamara west of kormilda college was the northern territory runner-up, while emily stewart, formerly of palmerston senior college, was the northern territory winner. it was wonderful that they were here yesterday.

500,Australian Medical Association,"one solution that must be considered is creating greater competition in the primary health services industry. removing impediments to the number of new graduates in medicine and dentistry will increase competition in the health marketplace. it has come to my attention that members of the australian dental association and the australian medical association also hold positions on university entrance boards. i have been informed these organisations, and prominent members within these organisations, influence the number of students offered university places in medicine and dentistry. the serious restraint of trade must be rectified. operating in a similar manner to that of medieval guilds centuries ago, looking after the best interests of their members alone, ignores the far greater social obligation of medical practitioners. how can competitive market forces put downward pressure on prices if the major medical associations are running a monopolistic chop shop which dictates how many graduates can qualify and serve the community as practitioners?",4
248,Australian Coal Association," the australian coal association recently commissioned economic consultants to examine the impact of the tax and they found that conservative estimates of employment forgone in 2020-21 from applying emissions pricing to current coal mines would be around 4,700 in coal mines and 14,100 throughout the entire economy. so it's not looking so rosy now, is it?",3
245,Australian Christian Lobby," (dawson) (13:13): in a video recorded for the australian christian lobby and for the benefit of people of faith right across this country, just before the 2009 election, the prime minister made this statement: that is a pretty clear, explicit and unequivocal statement from the prime minister, from the leader of the labor party. to press the point, in the context of this interview, the interviewer—the australian christian lobby's managing director, brigadier jim wallace—went on to ask the prime minister:",3

1574,Speech Pathology Australia," (queensland) (17:54): in june 2011, the speech pathology australia national president ms christine stone first contacted the community affairs references committee. at that time, there was a request for more consideration of the need for speech pathology services across australia. there was also a desperate plea for coordinated research into the need and location of speech therapy services so that our country can respond with an effective plan to address that need and to ensure that we maintain the highest quality of speech pathology in our nation. i want to mention the wonderful work of speech pathology australia. they shared information with us, they provided academic research to us and they gave us referrals so we could talk more closely with families and organisations where there was need. other senators have spoken about other site visits. we need to thank those people for coming to talk with us and to reinforce the need that speech pathology australia shared with us in 2011. the services are extraordinary. the need is great. but we as a nation have a responsibility to ensure that the services that are available to some are available to all, because we know it makes a difference. i hope to be able to speak many times in this place and pick up on some of the issues that came out through the people we met. the important thing now is that this particular report is taken up by governments so that together they can identify the needs that they have to ensure that services are effectively identified and resourced. we need to continue to ensure that those communication needs are met, that the personal cost to individuals and society at large can be acknowledged and that we can respond to that need by having the strongest possible services across our nation.",4

13,Adult Learning Australia," in october last year, on abc radio, the chief executive of adult learning australia, sally thompson, said that she saw many disadvantaged students being recruited to training companies outside the local centrelink office. she said the promoted courses were expensive and that they were not appropriate for long-term unemployed people with higher needs. in particular, she said: their commitment as individuals to seeking either a training place or a job is something that we should commend them for. despite the difficulties they are dealing with, they are actively out there, trying to get a start. the fact that somebody can come in at that point in their life and with foresight and knowledge unscrupulously take advantage of them and walk away with a profit and leave them with a significant debt is absolutely disgraceful. i have heard in some examples from my colleagues that some of these 'spruikers', as sally thompson from adult learning australia described them, make comments to people such as, 'don't worry about the debt. you'll never had to repay it. until you earn $53,000 a year, you will not have to repay it.' in actual fact, the reality for them is that it is still going to be a debt of concern in their life.",3

898,Consumers Health Forum of Australia," as the consumers health forum of australia research shows, copayments will result in people delaying treatments, leading to higher health costs overall. there is a significant body of international evidence to show that copayments create barriers to access to health care for many consumers without decreasing overall healthcare costs. the eight-year-long rand health insurance experiment found that greater cost-sharing reduced appropriate or needed medical care as well as inappropriate or unnecessary medical care. in fact, the experiment also found that the poorest in society are most likely to defer medical treatment when the price increases, meaning that the health costs of this policy will disproportionately fall on our poorest citizens, including the unemployed and the elderly. this longer-term impact will be compounded by the $5 copayment for pbs-listed medicines, and the abolition of, among others, the national preventive health agency, which is focused on promoting preventive health approaches and primary health care designed specifically to reduce pressure and costs in hospital and acute settings.",3

782,Bravehearts," (tasmania—deputy government whip in the senate) (21:51): i recently attended and had the pleasure of representing the honourable julie collins mp, the minister for community services, at bravehearts' white balloon day ball in launceston, tasmania—an exhilarating and successful event. bravehearts was established in very sad circumstances. hetty johnson founded white balloon day in brisbane during child protection week in september 1997. white balloon day was created in response to the revelation that a family member was a paedophile. a brave disclosure by a seven-year-old led to the realisation that this much loved family elder had preyed on innocent children and their trusting parents for 40 years. compounding this strategy was the fact that this 40-year reign of terror had never been disclosed, let alone reported. whilst this sounds difficult to believe, this is a very common pattern. australian government statistics suggest that one in five children is sexually assaulted at some time before they are 18—that is 59,000 per year. if we look at facts and stats compiled by bravehearts, we get information that would lead you to believe that the comments of dr bill glaser are undeniably true. he wrote paedophilia: the public health problem of the decadeand said: although bravehearts is a relatively young organisation, their achievements are considerable. i will list just a few. in 1999, white balloon day was launched as a national event at parliament house, canberra. in that year the queensland police service reported a 514 per cent increase in disclosures as a result. in 2000, bravehearts advocated for survivors' rights to speak publicly, resulting in inclusion of section 189 in queensland's child protection act 1999. in 2001, bravehearts launched the sexual assault disclosure scheme in queensland. in 2002, bravehearts successfully lobbied for children's rights to civil compensation in queensland. in 2003, ditto's keep safe adventure child protection cd-rom was launched. in 2004, bravehearts expanded into western australia. in 2005, they launched the ditto's keep safe adventure school based personal safety program. in 2005, bravehearts received an australian crime and violence prevention award from the australian institute of criminology. in 2006, bravehearts launched supporting hands workshops for people working with children. in 2007, they officially opened an office in sydney, new south wales. in 2008, they received funding through the family violence prevention legal services, in the indigenous law and justice branch of the federal attorney-general's department, to establish an education branch in cairns, queensland. further, in 2009, bravehearts participated in the development of the national child protection framework, endorsed by coag on 30 april 2009. this ensured that child sexual assault would be understood and dealt with separately to other forms of child abuse and neglect. in 2010, bravehearts was provided with a funding grant through the launceston city council, in my home state, to provide free professional development training to psychologists, counsellors and other mental health practitioners in tasmania, and training and information workshops to child protection workers and those working with children generally. in 2011, ditto's education program launched in tasmania. in march this year, the 200,000th child saw ditto's keep safe adventure show. bravehearts has now released the 3 piers to prevention—a strategic plan that aims to halve the number of australian children sexually assaulted by 2020. the three piers—educate, empower and protect—are solid foundations identified by bravehearts to fulfil its pledge to make australia the safest place in the world to raise a child by 2020. the three piers are: educate—all children to receive effective personal safety education; empower —all adults are trained, aware and motivated; and protect—all systems of community and government. it is the culmination of 16 years of intensive research into how to reduce the incidence and, ultimately, prevent the occurrence of child sexual assault across australia. this is a fully researched and budgeted strategic business plan, which has been developed by bravehearts in consultation with thousands of schools, child protection agencies and police in each state and territory. bravehearts estimates that it will cost $8million per year to deliver on its pledge, while saving $5.22 billion each year and preventing around 28,000 children from enduring sexual harm. other than the vigour, enthusiasm and effectiveness of this organisation, i am particularly impressed by the fact that only 13.2 per cent of their income is spent on fundraising and 81.4 per cent is spent on their direct service delivery. that so much of the funds are spent on fulfilling their aims and objectives is truly impressive. clearly bravehearts is dedicated to the prevention of child sexual assault, and i congratulate them on their impressive work. i would like to take the opportunity to congratulate the team leaders in tasmania on the excellent work that they are doing by bringing this issue to the fore in our community, and i commend their work.",3
1185,Insurance Council of Australia," i believe that we should look seriously, and i am encouraged that some people would like to have this debate, at the concept of a national natural disaster fund of some sort that would have guidelines that would remove the complications that occur from time to time. on a number of occasions prior to the queensland floods last year—quite an incredible event; there is no doubt about that and, obviously, parts of new south wales and victoria suffered under similar circumstances—i did some research into the cost to communities of natural disasters, although i am not saying the cost of the total road network and all of the infrastructure. these are communities that have been covered by insurance. i think it was the case that prior to cyclone larry in queensland there had been one event that had a cost of over a billion dollars a year. that had been one such event in the previous 20 years. i can be corrected on this but some time back i had reason to engage with the insurance council of australia to try to help get some numbers around that. if you look at it, you see that in most years disasters in australia probably cost australia somewhere between $200 million and $400 million a year. obviously, other events since the floods last year or even taking last year's floods make that look like small cheese.",3
1407,Ovarian Cancer Australia," this friday, to continue the theme of teal ribbon day, i am hosting a 'morning teal' for ovarian cancer in my electorate of brisbane. we are extremely fortunate that our guest speaker at friday's morning tea, dr michael gattas, is one of the world's foremost experts on ovarian cancer. dr michael gattas is a renowned clinical geneticist. i am grateful that he has made the time in his very busy schedule to help increase awareness and understanding of this disease. our best prevention is greater awareness, understanding the disease and its symptoms, and encouraging other women to do the same. all proceeds from the event are going to ovarian cancer australia to continue the great work that they do in educating and informing women about this disease. according to ovarian cancer australia, around one in five australian women cannot name one symptom of the disease. this statistic is made more tragic when you realise that more than two-thirds of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer are at an advanced stage, making successful treatment difficult. but it is never too late to help prevent another life lost to this disease. indeed, it is never too late to educate ourselves about detection and prevention because the risk of developing ovarian cancer increases with age. ovarian cancer is not a silent disease because there are symptoms. every australian woman needs to be aware of these: abdominal or pelvic pain, increased abdominal size or persistent abdominal bloating, needing to urinate often or urgently, feeling full after eating a small amount. there are plenty of avenues of support, and that is something that we women do best. i applaud the work of ovarian cancer australia and their efforts to raise awareness of the disease so that, as we have done with cervical cancer, australia can help lead the way in reducing the incidence and preserving the lives of more and more australian women. prevention begins with greater awareness.",3

1135,Homelessness Australia," (western australia) (14:33): i thank the senator for his answer and i rise on a supplementary question. senator fifield, in the context of the $115 million you identified, i presume you are aware—through you, mr president—that that amounted to a cut of $44 million. will the government be restoring that cut, made as part of the extraordinary cuts to the housing and homelessness portfolio? and will the government immediately reinstate the $21 million it cut from peak bodies like homelessness australia just three days before christmas?",1
1334,National Farmers' Federation," the legislation before us will make a difference. it is about reform of three policy areas. i have talked about such reforms on numerous occasions and do not intend to talk much further about them, but the legislation aligns our antidumping and dumping countervailing systems with those of our free-trade organisation counterparts. we are hamstrung by the decision of the howard government, as i have said before in other speeches, and we have to get around it in some way that does not breach our obligations. we need to improve our timeliness, our expertise and our examination procedures. we have already considered the idea of improving locus standi organisations which can take on antidumping cases. when industry, the unions and the national farmers federation are all singing from the same hymn sheet, you know you are on the right track. in politics you cannot always get everyone on your side, but you know that you are doing something right when they are all saying that we should be doing what we are doing.",3
815,Catholic Health Australia," catholic health australia held similar worries. in its submission to the senate it stated: finally, it noted that 'there is a significant overlap between the roles and functions of' this authority 'and the australian commi­ssion on safety and quality in healthcare.' catholic health australia echoed many of those points in calling for clarity on the role of the authority, noting that the australian commission on safety and quality in healthcare, the australian institute of health and welfare and the australian bureau of statistics already collect data on hospitals and health services. cha also wanted the legislation drafted in such a way that the governance arrangements of the authority would reflect the make-up of australia's health system and therefore would have members with knowledge of public and private hospitals, primary health care and private or non-government healthcare provision.

1510,Royal Australian College of General Practitioners," the bill was also the subject of a senate committee inquiry. submissions to the senate inquiry raise even greater concerns about this bill. the royal australian college of general practitioners warns that the provisions of this bill hold long-term threats to 'harm the current high standard of medical services, and consequently health services, delivered to the community'. apart from those overriding issues, stakeholders found a myriad problems with this bill. the royal australian college of general practitioners was concerned about virtually every aspect of the proposed performance authority from its composition to its functions and powers, its independence and its relationship to the other authorities this government has established and is proposing to establish. a body with such wide-ranging reach over every aspect of health care, the college submitted, should draw on expertise from all sectors, yet the only specification for the make-up of the authority in this legislation is that one of its members must have experience in rural health. the college pointed out that it was unclear whether general practice will be monitored by the authority, and clarity is needed on the issue. it fears that if general practice is to be monitored then onerous data collection and reporting requirements could be imposed on already overworked and overstretched gps and could subtract from their capacity to deliver services to communities.",3
1160,Inspire Foundation," the member for bradfield referred to some of the health initiatives in his contribution. he did make the point that some of them indeed do not require the speeds which will be available under the nbn. but i will tell you what they do require, and that is symmetry. they require good upload capacity, as well as download capacity, and these sorts of service delivery models will be delivered under fibre based technologies. in particular, i want to take three issues, if i can get them done in a few minutes. the first one is the health sector which, indeed, indicated not only important improvements but significant improvements in the delivery of services, particularly to people in more remote areas, people with disabilities who have trouble accessing health services and young people who are more likely to access, in particular, mental health services online. the report goes through many examples. in particular, i would refer people to the section on mental health and the evidence, provided by, in particular, helen pepper, who is the youth ambassador for inspire foundation, about the importance of good-quality online mental health services for young people. the inspire foundation indicated their desire to expand their model, which they would be able to do if they could get high-quality, synchronised video based services available online, which would enable them to have more group interactions and better quality service delivery.

1225,Lesbians," i am proud of the reforms that this labor government has made in removing those 85 pieces of discriminatory legislation, removing every piece of discriminatory commonwealth legislation bar one. it is time to remove this last piece of discriminatory legislation. some have said that this change is a threat to marriage, but i believe that the opposite is true. this change reinforces that marriage is a legal and social bond that many australians aspire to in order to demonstrate their commitment to their partner. even for those gay men and lesbians who do not want to get married, the message that this change sends is a powerful one. the message is: you are equal before australian law and you are equal in the australian community. no young man or young woman should feel that their same-sex attraction marks them out as a second-class citizen.",666
1559,Smith Family," the coalition believes the government should stop this unnecessary interference and let the approximate 600,000 entities in the not-for-profit sector do what they do best for our communities. under the banner of the charitable sector there are a number of services that include the work of some of australia's most well-known organisations, such as the australian red cross, world vision, the smith family, the rspca, ausaid as well as australia's religious community.",2
1437,Police Federation of Australia," i would like to offer my sincere condolences to the family of cole miller, a fine young queenslander who sadly lost his life to an unprovoked, alcohol fuelled coward punch only a few weeks ago in brisbane. in honour of cole miller and others who have lost their lives or been injured as a result of alcohol fuelled violence i would like to establish an inquiry to investigate the need for a national strategy to address and reduce the scourge of alcohol fuelled violence. no parent should ever have to endure the pain and suffering that cole's parents are currently dealing with. the community desperately wants action, and i am determined to see that change happens. i have been overwhelmed by the support for this inquiry from members of the community, including st vincent's hospital and the police federation of australia, and i hope that this motion will be supported.",3

1387,Nutrition Australia," attendees referred to a range of other programs that they felt had been successful in breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty. these include: the home interaction program for parents and youngsters, hippy, a parenting and early childhood program targeting families with young children; programs in schools to encourage respectful relationships; anger management courses to help young people; classes run by nutrition australia to teach people to prepare meals that include more fruit and vegetables; and the the jobs, education and training program, jet, program, which provides childcare at 10c an hour and which several attendees argued should be available for a longer duration. we also briefly discussed the 2012 act targeted assistance strategy which was chaired by gordon ramsay and which looked at what the act government can do to better deal with hard-core disadvantage in our city.",1
282,Australian Council of Social Service," those opposite do not see supporting households through the transition to a clean energy future as important. not only will their plan to cut emissions, which one can only hope they still hold, cost the average household $1,300 per year but they will also rip away the government's entire household assistance package. so not only will those opposite seek to slug households with a $1,300 new tax that they will give to some polluters, whom they have chosen, but they will rip away any assistance that includes any increases in the pension, unemployment benefits and family tax benefits. so much for looking after consumer confidence! just yesterday, the australian council of social service said:",3
1334,National Farmers' Federation," the only other body to indicate support for this bill and for the abolition of the national water commission, in the senate process at least, was the national farmers' federation. again, this is a body for whom i have a terribly high regard. it is a body that has been a very constructive and deeply engaged player in the whole process of water reform for very obvious reasons: it goes to the utter heart of the health of the agricultural sector. but i have to say that its support ultimately for this bill and the abolition of the national water commission is tepid at best. the federation's initial response to the abolition of the commission was to reject the idea that this body be abolished. it was presumably only brought around by very furious lobbying by members of the government after the remit of the productivity commission was changed and made more specific. i congratulate the work of the federation in at least getting the government to provide some more specific expertise within the productivity commission to do the work previously done by the national water commission. but again, with respect, i disagree with the conclusion that the national farmers' federation has reached about this. i am convinced, and labor is convinced, that the better approach to continuing the work of the national water initiative and the important work of water reform would be to keep that body of expertise in the national water commission. beyond the national irrigators' council and the national farmers' federation—two incredibly important players, i acknowledge that, in the process of water reform—every other stakeholder, as far as i can tell, is opposed to this bill. the two other significant peak bodies—the australian water association and the water services association of australia—indicated quite strongly their opposition to the abolition of the national water commission. the water services association of australia in its evidence to the senate inquiry around this bill said of the abolition that it:",3
1219,Law Council of Australia," it is well-known that this process is inefficient and time-consuming. it adds stress to the applicants. the discretionary role of the minister in this process causes excessive uncertainty and delays for applicants seeking protection. over the years, a broad consensus has formed over the need for complementary protection provisions to be explicitly incorporated into domestic legislation. groups supportive of such a legal codification include: the united nations; the australian human rights commission; amnesty international; the uniting church; the law council of australia; and the refugee council of australia.

328,Australian Family Association," by the early 1980s, santamaria had refocused his energies on combating the new gramscian strategy of the 'long march through the institutions' adopted by the left. both old communists looking for new causes and libertarians were seeking to change australian society through demolishing or restructuring the family, religion, education and culture. santamaria engaged in this new struggle through publications such as news weekly and ad2000,as well as through ancillary organisations such as the australian family association.",1
237,Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry,"the minerals council of australia also welcomed the 'reduction in the complexity of the regulatory framework'. the master builders association said a national regulator would deliver 'consistent robust national regulation of training providers and courses.' and acci, the australian chamber of commerce and industry, said that the establishment of the nvr would help to rectify problems with poor-quality providers and their lack of compliance with state and territory quality requirements. it is clear from the comments of these stakeholders that the creation of the nvr will improve the quality of australia's vet system and reduce red tape for business. it will deliver these outcomes for more than 1.2 million students and thousands of australian businesses committed to the sector. as the minister for tertiary education, skills, jobs and workplace relations, senator evans, has said:",3
916,Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia,"to ensure that australia's abtc appropriately supports small to medium sized business owners in their international trade and investment activities, diac will be undertaking a review of the current eligibility criteria. this review is underway and will involve consultation with key business organisations, including the council of small business organisations of australia and bilateral business councils. diac's industry outreach officers, who work with these organisations on a regular basis, have also provided a list of key stakeholders including small to medium sized businesses to be involved in the consultations.",4
1340,National Heart Foundation of Australia," a significant number of public health experts have expressed unequivocal support for the proposal. for example, the australian medical association, the royal australasian college of surgeons, the public health association of australia, the cancer council, the national heart foundation of australia and the national stroke foundation have each welcomed the measure on the grounds that it will help to reduce smoking in australia, it will help save lives and it will improve the health of many thousands of australians.",3
1334,National Farmers' Federation," if i could just bring my comments to a close, what i would like to do in summarising is say that it is great that we have ways and we have people working on how we can save money; $7 million is $7 million, and it is really important to save $7 million when we can see it. but not at the cost of losing the trust of the industry; not at the cost of losing the trust of the national farmers' federation. how often is it that the nff comes into this house and says to my colleagues opposite, 'this is not good legislation; this needs changes'?",3
1376,Naval Association of Australia," vietnam veterans day, originally a day to commemorate the battle of long tan in 1966, has now been adopted by all veterans. last saturday i had the pleasure of attending the long tan memorial dinner at rooty hill rsl, a dinner hosted by the rooty hill naval subsection of the naval association of australia. the subsection themselves were celebrating their 35th birthday on the night and had commodore bruce kafer, commandant of the australian defence force academy, there to cut their birthday cake. for me one of the highlights of the dinner was an address given by mr vin cosgrove from the st mary's vietnam veterans outpost where he recounted key events in the battle of long tan. he certainly captured everyone's attention through the events that he recounted on the night, and it was an important part of the evening to recognise what had gone on and the odds that were faced by our servicemen in that particular battle as part of the broader conflict. it was australia's most significant contact with the viet cong in the 10 years of the conflict itself. in may and june 1966 soldiers of the 6th battalion royal australian regiment, or 6rar as they are known, arrived in south vietnam. by august 1966 the australian task force base at nui dat was only three months old. concerned at the establishment of such a strong presence in their midst, the viet cong determined to inflict an early defeat on the australians. in the days before the battle itself radio signals indicated the presence of a strong viet cong force within five kilometres of the base, but patrols found nothing. on the night of 16-17 august nui dat came under fire from mortars and rifles. while the australians believed an assault would follow, none came.

383,Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association," in other words, this was a totally flawed piece of legislation which should not be before this parliament and the amount of amendments presented today clearly high­lights that fact. the australian healthcare and hospitals association publicly expressed concern about the lack of consultation by the federal government with stakeholders in march. in its submission to the senate inquiry, it stated:",3
1702,Women With Disabilities Australia," advocacy group women with disabilities australia estimates that over 70 per cent of women with disabilities have been victims of violent sexual encounters. pervasive and destructive abuse of this kind requires a serious response from government. that is why i welcome reports that the newly elected andrews labor government in victoria will open an inquiry into victoria's disability care system. however, all australians who have suffered abuse of this kind deserve justice. as such, i also echo calls by the leader of the opposition and the shadow minister for disability reform to establish an independent investigation into these allegations.",3
600,Australian Republican Movement," stirring stuff, wonderfully woven—there is nothing better than excellent writing. it compels you to read on and on. this book is one of those you cannot put down, even though it is a weighty tome. it tells the tale of the brutal transportation of men, women and children from georgian britain—and being a staunch advocate for the australian republican movement, hughes would probably prefer that to 'great britain'—into a harsh, cruel, penal system. this was the origin of modern australia.",1
328,Australian Family Association," (dawson—the nationals deputy whip) (13:50): the genesis, research, advocacy and ongoing support for the safe schools program is run by la trobe university's australian research centre in sex, health and society. in fact, the safe schools coalition is run out of that la trobe centre. research by the australian family association raised concerns about the centre's deputy director, gary dowsett, a long-time advocate of 'intergenerational sex', otherwise known as paedophilia. i refer to dowsett's article 'boiled lollies and band-aids' from the journal gay informationwhere he says: 'how different then is that gentle, tentative sexuality between parent and child from the love of a paedophile and his or her lover? that kind of love, warmth, support and nurture is an important part of the paedophilic relationship.' he argued in that journal article that paedophilia should be part of the gay movement and that it must be legally recognised and he depicted it as a part of a wider sexual liberation.",3
1334,National Farmers' Federation," it is worth reminding the house what happened with the sale of this land. the national farmers federation and the victorian farmers federation on behalf of local farmers approached the government to see whether this 250,000 hectares could be broken up into the original allotments so that family farmers could have the chance to buy this land. sadly, although they wrote to the government, a response was never given to that letter and that 252,000 hectares was sold as one package to an overseas investment company at what ended up being a rock-bottom price. i look forward to seeing how the senate inquiry views the sale of this land. since then we have seen state owned enterprises come in and buy land in western victoria and in new south wales, and once again there has not been proper transparency around these purchases. one of the things that i am hoping that we will see from the senate inquiry is a review of the inconsistencies in how we deal with urban land and rural land. with urban land, foreign governments are required to get the approval of the foreign investment review board before they can go ahead and purchase. rural land is treated differently. state owned enterprises can come in and purchase the land and then it just seems to be a flick-and-tick process with the foreign investment review board. we need to keep confidence in how we deal with foreign investment, because it is crucial to australia, and this senate inquiry should help us to do that. (time expired)",1
699,Australian University Sport," senator xenophon (south australia) (20:44): i rise to speak on the higher education legislation amendment (student services and amenities) bill 2010. i was just warming to senator cormann's speech. that does not mean i agreed with it, but i was just beginning to warm to it. i thought i should outline a brief history of voluntary student unionism in the context and then set out my views on this. it is important that we distinguish between what has been very much an ideological debate and one in which we need to have a practical outcome. this is what this bill intends to achieve. when voluntary student unionism was introduced by the howard government in 2005 it had a number of practical and quite drastic effects. i think they were acknowledged by the howard government when it provided $100 million of transitional funding to universities through three competitive funding programs. the vsu transition fund for sporting and recreational facilities allocated $85 million for 44 projects, the small business and regional campuses fund allocated $5 million for 19 projects and the regional university sports program provided $10 million over four years to australian university sport. i think that is a concession on the part of the howard government that there were going to be quite significant impacts on campus life.",1
1338,National Foundation for Australian Women," the government has argued, wrongly, that part of its goal is to force people into the workforce. the national foundation for australian women—who were, in fact, emailing people today—said that the proposed cuts to family tax benefit a and family tax benefit b are not likely to have any positive impact on female workforce attachment. they will hit hard in identifiable regions with high concentrations of low-income families and lack of employment opportunities—outer suburban areas of capital cities and in the regions. the coalition has form in claiming that cuts will improve workforce participation. that was the rationale when they were moving people from the parenting payment for single people, which effectively cut their payments and forced thousands of single parents into poverty by living on newstart. the evidence shows that an approach like this will not work, but this government appear not to care about the evidence or about what their cuts will do to families. they are continually cutting payments from the most vulnerable. but simply bullying people will not mean that they can find work; simply cutting out their supports and making it harder for them to raise children will not mean that the jobs are there for people to be able to find work. as the national foundation for australian women points out, the areas where this will hit hardest are, in fact, those where people are less likely to be able to find work.",3
813,Caritas Australia," foreign aid is another facet of the budget. i noticed that caritas australia very strongly commended the decision by the government to move its foreign aid commitment to 0.35 per cent of gross national income, which is a step towards to the commitment to 0.5 per cent. it is a step forward, but i and many other members of this parliament will continue to advocate for the government to place an even higher priority on it. caritas also noted that despite this significant advance it still places australia only 14th out of the 23 oecd countries, and these are the countries we should compare ourselves with. they said: the responsible increase of aid and development spending, announced tonight, will see australia increase the delivery of life-saving development initiatives in some of the world's least developed countries. when the government is in belt-tightening mode, caritas australia welcomes ausaid's commitment to prioritise the poorest of the poor.",3

408,Australian Information Industry Association,"the changes that we are debating today are exactly that—good, quality changes that are well supported. contrary to what we have heard in this place, the changes are supported by many senior and eminent people in business and in industry, people who have the experience and the knowledge to comment on these issues. the changes have been supported by people like mr ian birks, the ceo of the australian information industry association; dr anna lavelle, ceo of ausbiotech; mr antony reed, ceo of the games developers association of australia; and a whole host of others, including tgr biosciences, the australian coal association research program, the australian industrial research group, the ceo of medicines australia, the tax council of the institute of chartered accountants, the ceo of the australian private equity and venture capital association and a range of other people. it is actually quite a widely supported amendment.",3
89,Association of Independent Retirees," superannuation is a particularly important reform for my electorate. the bills here, and the part of the package that we are undertaking, are particularly important. i lobbied hard to make sure that we lifted the superannuation guarantee age limit from 70 to 75. we have done that, meaning another 18,000 australians aged 75 years and over will get the benefit of superannuation if they continue to work. i talked about that issue just last week at the ipswich association of independent retirees and superannuants. i received a very favourable response about that because, as many of them said to me briefly, they were undertaking or have undertaken a transition in relation to their work-life situation. the days when people always just decided to retire and go from work to retirement are over. often people transition all the way through. making sure that they can pick up superannuation in those latter years is an important reform.",3
307,Australian Diabetes Council," so, as we have always known, moderation is the key. it is important to highlight some interesting facts related to this debate in australia. according to alan barclay from the australian diabetes council and the glycemic index foundation, sugar consumption in australia has actually dropped by 23 per cent since 1980. despite this, during that time cases of overweight or obese people have doubled, while diabetes has at least tripled.",3

670,Australian Steel Institute," also, what happens when an importer starts playing the system? i will give you an example that was put to me by the australian steel institute. concerns were raised by the australian institute regarding the capability of australia's antidumping and countervailing system to deal with ongoing issues. for example, duties were placed on certain types of imported steel products including pipes. the australian steel institute also provided examples of manufacturers changing factory locations in other countries and swapping between two factories in different countries to avoid duties. their concern, and i think the general concern, is that australia's system is not working efficiently in relation to the constant monitoring of products and that australian manufacturers have to make additional applications with additional cost and additional damage to their industry, given the time it takes to process a new application, to address any avoidance on the part of exporters. the example was given about pipes with brackets on them: whack on a $10 bracket from a bunnings or a mitre 10 store or wherever and suddenly it is in a whole new product category and they can avoid duties. is the government familiar with that particular instance and would that be seen as an example of noncooperation in the context of the dumping regime?",3
282,Australian Council of Social Service,"this levy is small. it is very small. a $1.8 billion levy, in terms of the magnitude of a commonwealth budget, is tiny, and it is something that is well supported and understood in the community—although there have been some who have tried to bring about some misconceptions about what this levy actually represents. but it is well understood and it is well supported. it is certainly supported by the australian council of social service, by the salvation army and by agforce in queensland. brent finlay, the president of agforce queensland, said:",3
407,Australian Industry Group,"—i thank the leader of the opposition for his question. of course, it points to the debate that we have been having, in this parliament and beyond, over the last few days about economic reform, about pursuing economic reform or about seeking to wreck economic reform. i would refer the leader of the opposition to my speech to the australian industry group dinner in parliament house earlier this week. he, unfortunately, was not able to be in attendance, but a number of members of his political party were in attendance so they would be able to advise him of those words.",1
1334,National Farmers' Federation," whilst the government claims the reregistration process will increase the scrutiny of suspect chemistries, the reality is that the increase in administrative workload for apvma staff will reduce the resources available to deal with critical registrations and permits. farmer groups have noted that the current proposal appears to betray the fact that apvma does not have appropriate internal systems in place to maintain an orderly, risk-based system for chemical reviews. we heard the member for murray comment on the fact that the national farmers' federation is quite satisfied with the system in place at present—quite happy with the status quo. why is the government meddling with this? why is labor sticking its nose in where it is not wanted?",3
826,Central Australian Aboriginal Congress,"—i thank senator siewert for her question on alcohol in alice springs. as this chamber would be aware, the government is working extremely hard in terms of closing the gap and a great deal of work has been undertaken in reducing the harm from alcohol, which is a significant issue amongst numerous indigenous communities. the government has been working with the territory government and is leading work on an alcohol management plan as another key component of the alice springs transformation plan. new funding is being allocated by the australian government to strengthen local alcohol support services for aboriginal people in key areas of alcohol rehabilitation. this includes an additional $5.4 million to the central australian aboriginal congress safe and sober support service to help address harmful alcohol use. in partnership with the territory government, the australian government is also providing $1.5 million to expand id card technology to help enforce alcohol restrictions in alice springs and elsewhere. in regards to the issues senator siewert has raised, i will seek further information.",4
835,Chartered Secretaries Australia," i am surprised that the coalition are not supporting this bill. i know there is a strong tradition in the conservative parties of supporting the charitable sector and of reducing regulation. i am disappointed that the member for menzies has chosen to run something of a scare campaign on this bill and has chosen to suggest that the government is increasing regulation; whereas, in fact, we are in fact simply doing what so many inquiries, going back to an inquiry under the coalition in 2001, have recommended—that is, to take the approach that britain, canada and new zealand have taken, to cut through the duplication by allowing the equivalent of a charities passport. the member for menzies has been selectively quoting from the sector and has not recognised in many cases that organisations he has quoted strongly support the bill. for example, acoss, the community council for australia, the national roundtable of nonprofit organisations, philanthropy australia, the smith family, the rspca and chartered secretaries australia are all supporters of the australian charities and not-for-profits commission. i commend the bill to the house.",3
929,Customer Service Institute of Australia," (south australia) (14:46): my question is to the minister for defence, senator payne. i refer to the shock departure of mr peter howman as the managing director of defence housing australia, or dha, a fortnight ago. mr howman's departure came just days after the customer service institute of australia named him their customer service ceo of the year and also presented dha with a service excellence award. under mr howman, dha has been one of the country's best performing government business enterprises, with a net profit after tax of $91.1 million last financial year. minister, what circumstances led to mr howman's departure from dha, and were you consulted?",1
860,Clean Energy Council," this shift to renewable energy in south australia can be attributed to extremely strong support from the state labor government in its quest for environmental sustainability and for the benefits to be reaped from greater investment in clean energy generation. south australian premier mike rann, a big supporter of clean energy generation, recently stated that there are over 530 operational turbines in south australia. these signify investments worth billions of dollars, all from private investors, with the clean energy council stating that the approximate total capital investment in south australia is around $2.8 billion. looking at the statistics in the clean energy council's july snapshot, i am proud that south australia, at 54 per cent, accounts for more than half of australia's wind farm operating capacity. it is a significant achieve­ment for a state that accounts for less than 10 per cent of the nation's population. wind energy in south australia accounts for around 3,223 direct and indirect jobs. these are all significant figures in renewable energy development. they have set a strong base for future progress, and we already have proven success in wind energy generation. this announcement by suzlon shows a continuing level of interest from investors due to the opportunities that wind generation have presented in south australia. even before the announcement by suzlon energy, the clean energy council's july snapshot painted a rosy picture in presenting the proposed wind energy stats for south australia. currently, there are 14 proposed wind farms in south australia, which could possibly result in another 648 turbines. the equivalent energy produced will be able to power more than 567,000 homes. this could see another 948 direct jobs created in south australia. nationally, the stats show that 90 wind farms are under consideration by planning authorities, possibly adding another 5,000 turbines to the 1,153 turbines operating at the moment. the clean energy council, in its report renewable energy jobs in 2009 and forecasts for 2020, projected that through the government's renewable energy target there could be as many as 30,000 employed in this industry by 2020. these opportunities are significant, and i believe that cleaner forms of energy have the support of the majority of australians. i hope that during my time here as a senator for south australia the development of wind energy and other forms of renewable energy will continue to head in the right direction, because i understand that the next generation of south australians and australians want a cleaner environment and want the opportunities of a clean energy economy.",3

1358,National Rural Health Alliance," a key element of the package includes a $225 million flexible grants program for dental infrastructure, which will not commence until 2014. the invitation to apply for funding under that grants program will not commence until 2014. this is a critical point that deserves some further examination. as i travel around the great southern region of western australia, the needs of regional and rural australians and their oral health needs are an issue that is constantly raised with me. it is interesting to reflect on the work of a national rural health alliance and the work that it has done in regard to dental care in rural and remote australia. it has said that there were 57.6 practising dentists per 100,000 population in major cities compared to 28.5 in outer regional and 19.8 in remote australia; and 33.7 per cent of regional and remote dentists are busier than they would prefer compared to 17 per cent in major cities. they also said that around 73 per cent of all regional-remote dentists are 40 years or over compared to 60 per cent in major cities. conversely, only 27 per cent of dentists working in regional or remote areas are under 40 years of age compared with around 40 per cent in major cities. it is quite clear from this evidence and the evidence of other coalition senators that dental health needs are important but that this government has been lazy in providing a suitable policy response.",3
1334,National Farmers' Federation," it is good also to be able to go through some of the details of why this advantage, this expansion in beef, is going to get even better—a market for fresh, chilled and frozen. we sold $787 million worth of beef there last year. it currently has a 12 to 25 per cent tariff on it. but after the excellent work of the minister for trade and investment, that tariff, in nine years, is going down to zero. in sheep meat, for which we had $446 million worth of sales last year under a coalition government, that tariff—it has currently got a 12 to 23 per cent tariff—after eight years is going down to zero. for goat meat the tariff is currently at 20 per cent, and it is going down after eight years to zero. for bovine offal, it is going from 12 per cent down to zero. sheep and goat meat offal is also going down to zero. we are actually reducing these tariffs. this is going to bring an explosion in further exports into one of our major markets. an explosion such that meat and livestock australia has said that out to 2030 this is going to be worth $3.3 billion in the beef industry alone. it is going to be worth $1.8 billion in the sheep meat industry. the national farmers' federation said this agreement is an 'outstanding achievement that will build on australia's important trading future'. but what does the shadow minister for agriculture say? this is what the shadow minister for agriculture, the alternative government, said: 'there can be no doubt that the benefits are overstated.'",3
1514,Royal Institute for Deaf and Blind Children," this scheme will complement the work of organisations that i have had a great deal to do with in recent years: organisations like the nepean area disabilities organisation in penrith; great community transport, which serves the blue mountains and the nepean area; the penrith disabilities resource centre; the royal institute for deaf and blind children; the thorndale foundation; and northcott disability services in parramatta. i have met with representatives from those organisations on many occasions and even recently with senator fifield, who was in western sydney for a meeting with those organisations at a round table in emu plains. top of their agenda is the ndis. for people like denise heath from the nepean area disabilities organisation and denise roberts from the penrith disabilities resource centre this is a seminal moment in how they do their jobs and how their organisations operate. i must say that, although i knew them to be highly competent and efficient heads of their various organisations, the forethought and consideration they displayed on that day to both senator fifield and me of how their organisations may work within the ndis was extremely impressive.",2

639,Australian Society for Medical Research,"i am also privileged to have living in my electorate the president-elect of the australian society for medical research, dr paul dawson. the australian society for medical research is one of the nation's peak professional bodies, representing approximately 160,000 researchers around australia. i recently met with dr dawson to discuss the issues that he regarded as most important to his industry. funding was his top priority. as dr dawson rightly pointed out, australia is faced with an ageing population. with an ageing population comes increased costs and burdens on our health industry that this government and state labor governments around the country are clearly already struggling to manage. continued support for research is as vital as it is valuable. the australian society for medical research estimates that for every dollar invested in research and development, an average of $2.17 of health benefits is returned—more than double—with a minimum of 57c and a maximum of up to $6.",3

1357,National Rugby League,"we also see the investment in local infrastructure and the $800 million program for priority regional infrastructure projects. it is magnificent to see what has been achieved on the ground in relation to community infrastructure projects. just this last saturday i was down at the bega rec ground, where $200,000 of government investment made it possible for us to attract national rugby league first-grade teams—the canberra raiders and the melbourne storm—to come and conduct a trial activity at that ground, which attracted a crowd of nearly 7,000 people and brought a lot of visitors into the region. more than that, the two teams spent an entire week in the region engaging with kids. they went to the high schools pursuing themes of decision making, eating healthily and engaging in active lifestyles. it was just a wonderful fillip for the entire region, all made possible by the investment in the bega recreation ground.",1

416,Australian Institute of Company Directors," what the government ought to be doing is getting out of the way of civil society and allowing them to operate appropriately and competently and to help each other—not creating a roadblock for civil society. a number of eminent australians and people who are known as philanthropists—or big v volunteers is perhaps another way to put it—are also concerned at the capacity this legislation has to discourage people from being prepared to volunteer. i refer in particular to mr david gonski, who is a life fellow of the australian institute of company directors and, amongst other things, is well known to all of us for his extraordinary work in the not-for-profit and charitable sector and even assisting governments with things like the recently produced gonski report. mr gonski said:",1
1334,National Farmers' Federation," rather than admitting they got it wrong, labor did the mua's bidding again in late 2015 and voted down our legislation. the senate's rejection of this reform was described by the national farmers federation as 'a missed opportunity to restore competition around the australian coast'. how can australia ever consider the labor party as an alternative government of this country when labor act so flagrantly in support of their union benefactors—the same benefactors who now run millions of dollars of mendacious advertisements paid for by the toil of the union's hardworking members?",3
298,Australian Dairy Farmers," in food production, farm producers are squeezed for lower prices by the major grocery retailers in turn placing hardship and stress on farming families. the current milk price war has been linked to the executive remuneration of the coles ceo with allegations that the coles ceo will be paid millions of dollars if he increases the coles profit. discounting milk is a strategy currently being employed by coles to increase market share of grocery sales and ultimately the coles profit. the australian dairy farmers say the discounted milk is already reducing the income of dairy farmers and threatens their ongoing viability. this is a claim that coles is disputing of course. we have also seen farm products being sourced from overseas where production standards do not meet australian standards, which in turn leads to health impacts on australian consumers and a demise of australian food production. again these are decisions made by executives whose primary interest is profit. the impact on australian farmers and the health impacts on australian consumers are ultimately borne by governments.",3
298,Australian Dairy Farmers," i take up the comment by the member for maranoa, who said that it is outrageous. it is outrageous and i think the regional families recognise that and see through this marketing gimmick. in that same vein, i would like to congratulate the operator of a locally owned supermarket, mr jim feltis from foodworks in sale, who has countered the corporate giants by putting forward his own position through his small supermarket of $2.50 for two litres of milk and donating 50c from the sale of each product to australian dairy farmers ltd. i think that is a good way to respond to that particular challenge. so i congratulate jim for the work that he does in our community as a supporter of so many different community organisations and sporting groups and for working in the community's interest, which i fear the major supermarket giants are not doing.",1

1334,National Farmers' Federation," i would like to add to an answer i gave today. today i stated that the labor party currently has an agriculture policy, but it is actually from hawker britton. it probably still does not have a policy. on the national farmers' federation, i did not realise that the nff is writing agriculture policy for the labor policy.",1
1334,National Farmers' Federation," as i said, these changes would apply at the federal level to federally registered trade unions and to federally registered employer organisations. by their breadth they are significant reforms. these have been done—and this is important to point out—in a very open way. the consultation itself has been conducted with industry associations and unions across the board. it has been done openly with peak employer bodies like the business council of australia, acci—the australian chamber of commerce and industry—master builders australia, ai group, the national farmers federation and the actu, all through the national workplace relations consultative council. this was a good approach, done openly and involving all groups; and again i make the point that those opposite cannot simply negotiate and consult one side of the equation and leave the others out. they cannot just talk to employers and fail to take into account employee concerns as well. we have tried to ensure that the breadth of consultation covers all views to try to balance those out. as the communique issued by the national workplace relations consultative council back on 25 may read:",4
1480,Real Estate Institute of Australia," while we are on the issue of superannuation: the member for blair spoke about the increase of super contributions from nine to 12 per cent. the government take the position that this is a wonderful initiative that they are putting in place. when i speak to my businesses they are horrified because they cannot see where the relief from the federal government is coming from to assist them with the increase in super from nine to 12 per cent. yes, there is a one per cent reduction in their company tax rate from 30 to 29 per cent but, even when questioned in estimates, the real estate institute of australia indicated that the three per cent increase in superannuation contribution by the businessperson, by the small mum and dad, was not going to be covered by the one per cent. you cannot have your cake and eat it too. you cannot call this a labor initiative and say that you are out there helping business when really, at face value, you are again putting your hands into the pockets of businesspeople, mums and dads, who are trying to employ people and you are asking them to pay for the increased contribution.",3
991,Energy Supply Association of Australia,"the department of climate change and energy efficiency data shows that australia's top 292 emitters pumped out 341 million tonnes of direct carbon emissions, leading to potential revenue of $8.2 billion if there was a carbon tax of $25 per tonne. then there is the financial impact on electricity generators themselves. energy supply association of australia chief executive, brad page, said:",3

1621,Tennis Australia," mr speaker, would you please advise or make appropriate inquiries as to whether the tennis australia event held yesterday evening at parliament house was a government funded event or a labor party funded event? if it was a government funded event, were representatives of tennis australia explicitly requested not to mention the event to members of the coalition? i ask this because, when i stopped to greet some of my friends from tennis australia, a staff member of the minister for small business asked me to leave, as it was 'an alp function'.",1
930,Customs Brokers and Forwarders Council of Australia," the second inquiry was conducted by the senate foreign affairs, defence and trade legislation committee which examined the provisions of the bills before the chamber, and we welcome the second report. during a prior inquiry into bills relating to the implementation of the kafta—the korea-australia free trade agreement—the senate legal and constitutional affairs legislation committee recommended that customs make available a table which refers to each of the specific provisions of the kafta, and identify where those provisions have been adopted or have been proposed to be adopted into legislation, regulation or procedure. such a table was subsequently produced and is now available on the australian customs and border protection service website. this is a practice which arose directly out of senate committee recommendations—an example of government and legislative process being improved through the adoption of senate committee recommendations—and i urge the government to continue to take this approach. i understand that a similar table in relation to the partnership agreement before us is not yet available, and will be after the legislative processes are finalised. labor's suggestion is that the recommendation of the committee—that the customs service make publicly available the table which refers to each specific provision and which also identifies where those provisions have been adopted or are proposed to be adopted, whether in the bills otherwise in legislation or regulations or by procedure—be accepted. so, consistent with recommendations not just from the senate committee but also from groups such as the customs brokers and forwarders council of australia and the export council of australia, i would ask the government to ensure that the table for the japan-australia economic partnership agreement be published today. i note that the minister's adviser is here in the box and i wonder if he could do us the courtesy, perhaps, of passing that indication from the opposition on to the government, particularly in light of our facilitation of the legislation before the chamber.",3

539,Australian Nursing Federation," i was really struck when i saw reports about how australia was falling behind the united states and europe, and certainly when dr karen daly attended a nursing conference. she has a phd and has been a campaigner for safety in the united states for a long time. the president of the american nurses association indicated that australia needed to get on board with the united states and europe in this regard. i have also had discussions in the past with people from the queensland nurses union. i know beth mohle, the secretary of the queensland nurses union, has been a strong advocate in this area for a very long time back in my home state of queensland. but i also noticed the comments of lee thomas, the federal secretary of the australian nursing federation, saying the health sector should align its safety protocols with legislation that requires use of engineering controls to eliminate foreseeable workplace hazards. lee was quoted as saying: she called for safety-engineered devices to be made available sooner rather than later. it is not just nurses but also people who work in medical administration who may be exposed to this problem. i commend also the alliance for sharps safety and needlestick prevention in healthcare. it is an alliance of a lot of organisations, including the australian nursing federation, the australasian society for infectious diseases, the australian society for microbiology, the royal college of nursing australia, the royal college of pathologists of australasia, and a number of other organisations who have been pushing this issue for quite a long time.",3

1055,Fred Hollows Foundation," (ryan) (17:06): i rise today to acknowledge the amazing work of the fred hollows foundation as they celebrate 20 years of restoring people's sight. i was pleased to be part of that recognition recently on 23 august at the official launch of in fred's footsteps: 20 years of restoring sight, a new book that charts the foundation's impact and achievements over the last two decades, and the following week, at a photo exhibition and event hosted by the premier of queensland, campbell newman. for the past 20 years, the fred hollows foundation has been working to restore vision to millions around the world, as well as teaching people in developing countries to undertake cataract surgery and manufacture eye lenses for themselves. indeed, since 1942 they have worked with blindness prevention organisations in 42 countries throughout africa, asia, the middle east, australia and the pacific region. fred hollows believed that everyone, everywhere, should have access to the best that modern medical knowledge can provide. as fred once said: 'every eye is an eye. when you are doing the surgery there, that is just as important as if you were doing eye surgery on the prime minister or the king.' as brian doolan, the ceo of the fred hollows foundation said in the book's introduction: the fred hollows foundation now operates in more than 20 countries. in the past five years alone, nearly one million sight-restoring operations and eye treatments have been carried out, which is approximately one every 2.6 minutes. the foundation has successfully developed a clear five-point strategy that is highly aligned with the international vision 2020: the right to sight. basically, that strategy is to (1) treat the disease, (2) ensure the local people are trained, (3) give the workers the tools to do their job, (4) build political will, and (5) ensure organisational strength. over the past 20 years, more than 220,000 australians and 10,000 organisations have put their hands in their pockets to support the work that fred began. the fred hollows foundation is a truly extraordinary organisation—indeed, it is a development organisation, not a medical charity. i commend the foundation on its 20th anniversary and urge all australians to help it to continue its vital work both in our own communities and overseas. as fred himself said in 1992: the world is a better place thanks to the aspirations of fred hollows and the ongoing work carried out by his widow, gabi, and the fred hollows foundation.",3
752,Benevolent Society," while i do welcome initiatives to help welfare-dependent teenage mothers get back to school, along with the support to help long-term welfare recipients get back into the workforce, i believe it is a shame that the government is only trialling these measures, as they could potentially bring positive change to so many struggling families within the macarthur region. for too long the people of macarthur have been stereotyped and it is a shame that the pilot program for teenage mums will not be trialled in my electorate even though it was announced in ambarvale by the prime minister. the tough love announcement was not very well received by community leaders. why announce it in the macarthur region and then not trial it there? just using the people of macarthur as tools to promote policy and then not spend a cent to assist them is beyond comprehension. the benevolent society, although welcoming the prime minister's announcement, also criticised the removal of payments to parents supporting young children as not helpful under any circumstances.

1369,National Tourism Alliance," i would like at this time to commend the tourism bodies that have led a very concerted and well-researched campaign on this: the tourism and transport forum, the australian federation of travel agents, the national tourism alliance and the australian tourism export council. in my electorate of leichhardt, tourism, of course, is one of the mainstay industries that have had a very, very tough time in recent years. no-one would argue that the tourism industry is not an industry that is exposed to factors such as the high value of the dollar and, of course, economic confidence.",4

125,Australia Tibet Council," (leichhardt) (11:11): on monday this week the australian all-party parliamentary group for tibet held an event in the parliament for tibet advocacy day. the aapgt is a bipartisan group whose purpose is to amplify tibet's voice in parliament through events such as tibet advocacy day. this year's event had a special focus on political prisoners and the human rights situation in tibet. together with my co-chair, michael danby mp, and other members of the group, we heard some telling personal stories from delegates whose lives have been directly impacted by china's harsh policies in tibet: mr lobsang lungtok, co-chair of the australia tibet council, previously a political prisoner in tibet; mr sonam paljor, australia tibet council board member; and ms tenzin chokey from south australia. tenzin visited parliament last year for advocacy day and is now working as a nurse in adelaide. the delegates' message to parliamentarians was to call upon the chinese government to release two political prisoners in particular: mr tenzin delek rinpoche and mr runggye adak. on 1 august 2007, runggye adak, a nomad from eastern tibet, stepped onstage at an official function at the lithang horse racing festival. while on stage he boldly grabbed the microphone and addressed a crowd of several thousand tibetans who had gathered for the annual festival, and he publicly called for the return of the dalai lama to tibet. for this simple, brave, passionate act he was arrested and sentenced to eight years in prison by the chinese authorities, who charged him with 'provocation to subvert state power'. runggye adak has now spent over seven years in prison and is in seriously poor health. the australia tibet council is calling on the australian government to seek confirmation that mr adak will be released at the completion of his sentence and that his political rights will not be suspended. the delegates also raised 31 march as the last day for countries to join the asian infrastructure investment bank, and it is believed the bank plans to build 20 dams across tibet. tibet is the source of five major rivers that feed into india, china, bangladesh and pakistan. if this water gets affected upstream, it could cause devastation in neighbouring countries downstream, given these countries all have agri-based economies. it is important that there be greater transparency about how the population in the fragile tibetan plateau will be affected by these dams. tibetans are not against development, but they want to make sure that development is inclusive of human rights, and you certainly cannot argue about that. our group had actually requested a visit to tibet to see the conditions firsthand, following discussions i initiated with the visiting chinese ambassador in early 2014. we are still waiting on that to be confirmed: we hope the proposal will be accepted, and we appreciate the assistance that we have had from our foreign minister, julie bishop. china must understand that if it has nothing to hide in tibet then there is no reason why unsupervised visits to the tibetan region should not be allowed. as we look towards 2015, we look forward to celebrating his holiness the dalai lama's birthday in july and continuing to support the great work of the australia tibet council to help create a better future for tibet.",3

1655,Transport Workers' Union of Australia," it is worth making the point at this juncture that, through countless inquiries, responses to incidents, responses to the media interest that has been aroused by this, and in dealing with families that have been traumatised, there is one organisation that has continuously, passionately and determinedly pressed the case for something to be done. i want to place on the record my admiration for the transport workers union of australia—in particular tony sheldon, michael kane, who i notice up in the gallery, and my friend and colleague the new south wales secretary wayne forno. in years to come, people will be able to say that the work done by this organisation has saved their lives or spared them from injury. there are people in this chamber who say that too much power has been wielded by one organisation in this matter; but to be honest i thank god that that power has been exercised because families have not had to be traumatised by the death of their loved ones, whether they are the people driving those vehicles or general commuters involved in accidents. i congratulate the twu for the work they have done.",4

1358,National Rural Health Alliance," the national rural health alliance estimates that the actual deficit in funding rural health requirements is in the order of $2.1 billion. that group highlights a range of other inequities, but in terms of the budget that is the quantum, that is the magnitude, that we are talking about. the government has responded with a number of initiatives and plans—for example, the national strategic framework for rural and remote health. on the surface that sounds good, except for the fact that, again, it does not actually take into account what rural health practitioners in communities are telling them. you have to question whether all the money placed into developing that framework, if it is not taking account of what is happening on the ground, is money well spent.",3
245,Australian Christian Lobby," i am pleased that the government has changed its party platform and are allowing its members to have a conscience vote. but we urgently need better leadership on this issue from the prime minister. i would think that after last week's ridiculous comments from the australian christian lobby there can no longer be any reason for the prime minister to seek to placate them and to remain silent, and to oppose same-sex marriage. by the same token, it seems to run completely counter to the notions of liberalism that we have tony abbott not allowing his members a conscience vote. how completely ridiculous is that? we have seen recent polls that show 52 per cent of coalition voters support equal marriage rights—and i would have thought that tony abbott would listen to polls, if nothing else; likewise, we have 64 per cent of australians who support marriage equality. frankly, it is about time we saw some leadership from both the prime minister and mr abbott in allowing a conscience vote, and in allowing this really important bill that the community wants to see passed go through.

840,Children with Disability Australia," there is nothing specific in the bill or in the regulation that creates any concrete expectations that education systems will be able to delivery fully on the national disability standards, or that australia's obligations as a signatory to the un convention on the rights of persons with disabilities or the un convention on the rights of the child will be met. it would seem quite relevant to me, and it was certainly a position put by children with disability australia that, at the very minimum, the obligations of this government to meet those standards should be referenced somewhere in the bill. children with disability australia described it as a national disgrace. they pointed out that 63 per cent of school children with a disability experience difficulty fitting in at school, 29.6 per cent of people between 15 and 64 with a disability completed year 12 compared to 49.3 per cent of people without a disability—that is almost half. they added that 12.7 per cent of people with a disability have a bachelor's degree or higher, and for people without a disability that figure is 19.7 per cent. around 15 per cent of australia's students require additional assistance, but only five per cent receive funded support. clearly, improving these measures over time is complex, but getting a start on it is urgent. students with disability have been marginalised in our system for long enough, and it beggars belief that, in 2013, this government would think that a system that somehow preferences special schools over students with disability in mainstream schools is a good thing. it is just unbelievable.",3
197,Australian Bankers' Association," under the formula prescribed by the bills, an entity with high earnings may incur a large entity component even though the entity only provides a small volume of designated services. there therefore exists the potential that the levy may have a disproportionate effect on those large entities which only provide designated services as an incidental part of their business. the australian bankers' association director, tony burke, said the government's clear objective was to recover costs rather than to provide any benefit to those subject to the regulation. he said:",3

197,Australian Bankers' Association," contrary to the claims of some in the house, these reforms did not appear mysteriously out of nowhere. we have had an extensive consultation process. my predecessor launched the green paper on 7 july 2010. then we announced, during the 2010 election campaign, that we would implement these very reforms. since that time, we have worked hard to consult with the banking industry to ensure these reforms were commercially workable while minimising implementation costs for industry. for example, in the lead-up to the deputy prime minister's announcement of the gillard government's comprehensive banking reform package—in the period prior, from july to december 2010—the department of the treasury met with the australian bankers' association in no less than nine highly productive, face-to-face meetings. the government has continued to work closely with industry on implem­entation. the result is a bill that minimises the implementation costs for industry while also meeting our objective to get australian families a better deal on credit cards.

463,Australian Lawyers Alliance," (victoria—manager of opposition business in the senate) (11:52): i think organisations such as the australian lawyers alliance have visited a number of senators and given evidence to the senate inquiry. i understand from what senator xenophon has said that his proposed amendments in the area of compensation reflect some of the concerns of organisations such as that. i would be interested in whether you have received any legal advice as to what the practical outworking of the proposition that senator xenophon has put forward may be, just to provide a little light, because being a layman i have read amendments such as his and it is not immediately apparent as to what the practical import may be.",3
1015,Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries," the former minister never delivered on his watch the stable policy settings that he was bleating about. is a stable policy setting changing the rules in relation to fbt? is that a stable policy decision? was there any consultation with industry in relation to the change to these pre-existing fbt rules? what about this minister, this inapt, in-out minister who has the gall to talk about what may or may not have happened in relation to these issues in this government's cabinet? where was the industry minister when these fbt changes were made? where was this former minister when a stable policy setting was required? he went missing. all those opposite know what a dramatic impact this proposal had. i will go through some of the commentary. the federal chamber of automotive industries, the fcai, undertook an analysis of the likely impact of the former government's decision, describing it as terrible news for the industry and concluding that it could have a dire effect on australian car production, including on the manufacturing supply chain—that is the component manufacturers. the very person we have heard bleating and seen crocodile tears from over the last week, the former minister, did not have the intestinal fortitude to ask the minister representing the minister for industry a question over three days. he is lacking intestinal fortitude, and he lacked the ability as a minister to provide the stable policy settings that might just have saved car manufacturing in this country.",3
922,Cricket Australia," it is, at best, a bitter consolation that phillip hughes died doing what he loved, but it is some consolation. he was 25 years old. he was 63 not out. the scorebook will show he will remain forever 63 not out. the outpouring of grief of his passing is a matter i have not previously witnessed for any other sportsman. it will be apparent to all in this chamber that the death of this young man has reached beyond that moment at the sydney cricket ground, and has reached well beyond cricket. in part, this is because of the quality of the overwhelmingly sensitive and appropriate coverage by the australian media of this terrible tragedy. i acknowledge the respect that they have shown. i also acknowledge the australian cricket team and cricket australia. they have been magnificent in the most difficult of circumstances.",1
1648,Timber Trade Industrial Association," i will just read through the submissions received for the inquiry. i think there is a bit of smoke and mirrors going on, that this was what i think senator wong likes to call a 'quick and dirty inquiry'. but we got a fair number of submissions, reflecting the full diversity and ideological positions of this particular area. we had the queensland nurses union, the timber merchants association of victoria, the maritime union of australia, master builders australia, the department of employment, the master plumbers and mechanical services association of australia, the australian industry group, the pharmacy guild of australia—and i really appreciate senator cameron getting in behind the pharmacy guild—the australian council of trade unions, the australian chamber of commerce and industry, the fair work commission, the australian nursing and midwifery federation, unions new south wales, the australian public transport industrial association, the australian community services employers association, the finance sector union of australia, the victorian automobile chamber of commerce, the timber trade industrial association, the australian manufacturing workers union and the national union of workers. that is a pretty comprehensive list!",4

66,Arthritis Australia," arthritis australia is a not-for-profit organisation and the peak arthritis organisation in australia. it is supported by affiliate offices in every state and territory, including my home state of tasmania. arthritis australia relies on the generosity of community groups, individuals and corporate sponsors for most of its funding. however, it also receives funding support from the department of health and ageing for a number of its projects. arthritis australia provides a number of important services to our communities: it provides support and information to people with arthritis as well as to their families and friends; it promotes awareness among leaders in business, industry and government of the challenges faced by the many people across the community who are living with arthritis; it funds research into potential causes and possible cures as well as better ways to live with arthritis; and it aims to keep health professionals such as physiotherapists, occupational therapists and community nurses informed. arthritis australia needs and deserves all the support we can give it. this support can be given in a number of ways. you can make a donation—including a special occasion donation for birthdays, anniversaries or weddings. you can become a member, a sponsor or a volunteer. you can make a bequest in your will or invest in arthritis research. as parliamentarians we can support arthritis australia even through small actions such as putting a link to the arthritis australia website on our own personal websites, as i have done. as a member of the parliamentary friends of arthritis group i attended a meeting at parliament house for the launch of a social impact study, the voice of arthritis, which was prepared by arthritis australia. the study highlighted in detail to what degree arthritis affects the lives of people with the disease. to help improve the lives of people with arthritis, the australian government has allocated significant funds through the better arthritis and osteoporosis care initiative. better arthritis and osteoporosis care is an initiative to improve prevention of arthritis and osteoporosis, to facilitate early detection and to improve management and quality of life for people with these conditions. running since 2006, the better arthritis and osteoporosis care initiative's emphasises work on juvenile idiopathic arthritis, improved primary care, self-management and secondary and tertiary prevention. in march, during arthritis awareness week, the minister for mental health and ageing, mark butler, announced $14.4 million to continue funding this initiative for a further four years. this initiative is guided by the national action plan for osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis, the evidence to support the national action plan, and a national service improvement frame­work for osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis. it provides funding for activities under the following strategic program areas: awareness raising, consumer education and self-management, health service improvement, health professional education, data monitoring and evaluation. the department is currently working with the national peak bodies—arthritis australia and osteoporosis australia—to deliver key components of the initiative, including workplace promotion, self-management and the local exercise program. the government also provides funding to health professional bodies and other government agencies under this initiative to deliver different programs including: national monitoring and surveill­ance of arthritis and musculoskeletal con­ditions, including osteoporosis; programs to assist health professionals gain a better understanding about caring for people living with arthritis and osteoporosis; and programs to evaluate the initiative. the government is also investing significant funding through existing initiatives and the national health reforms, which will benefit all australians, including people living with arthritis and osteoporosis. some of the major features include expenditure of $206 million in 2009-10 on relevant drugs for arthritis, osteo­porosis and musculoskeletal conditions under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme; $30 million in 2010 for research into arthritis, osteoporosis and other musculo­skeletal conditions through the national health and medical research council; chronic disease management items in the medicare benefits schedule; the home and community care program, a joint australian state and territory initiative, which provides a range of services, such as domestic assistance, home maintenance, professional allied health care and nursing services in order to support people to be more independent at home and in the community.",3

1316,National Breast Cancer Foundation,"—i too begin by applauding the member for shortland for this very, very important motion on breast cancer and join with the previous speakers in supporting such a wonderful initiative today, pink ribbon day. you would probably be aware that i have spoken on breast cancer many, many times in this house over the years. today is special. pink ribbon day is an initiative which was founded by the national breast cancer foundation to help raise funds for research into the prevention and cure of breast cancer. today, thousands of australians will host or take part in pink ribbon day events, including some that have already taken place at breakfast time this morning as well as dinners and cocktail parties—and the list goes on. although it is a fun way to raise money, it also raises very important awareness of such a very serious health issue. since the establishment of the national breast cancer foundation, over $67 million has been awarded to australian based researchers for the benefit of those affected by breast cancer. research programs funded by the nbcf have included work in genetics and in improving treatments and enhancing ways to support women and their families. in my electorate of reid we are very fortunate to host one of the best breast cancer centres in the world, and i have spoken about this on a number of occasions. under the leadership of professor david gillett, the strathfield breast centre is a private centre that provides a multidisciplinary, integrated service to assess and manage patients with breast diseases. i have had the pleasure of knowing professor gillett and many of his staff and colleagues since my election as a federal member in 1998 and i have come to appreciate the amazing research and treatment of patients with breast cancer that has been undertaken by the strathfield breast centre under the leadership of professor gillett. on a positive note, the national breast cancer foundation report that survival prospects for breast cancer patients are better than ever, with over 96 per cent of women surviving at least one year after diagnosis and 88 per cent of women surviving five years or more. this represents a 15 per cent increase since the 1980s. this is wonderful news. moreover, since 1994, deaths from breast cancer have decreased by something in the order of 27 per cent. these are very heartening figures and i am sure that the very good work that is being undertaken by researchers and surgeons like professor david gillett are greatly contributing to these improved results. i want to briefly share some stories from the national breast cancer foundation. these stories tell quite a lot about the seriousness of this disease. i will start with amanda's story. amanda was diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in 2002 at age 44. her mother and aunt also had breast cancer. she had four operations in six months, including a mastectomy of the right breast and removal of ovaries, causing instant menopause, in 2003. amanda has had a close association with the national breast cancer foundation, firstly on the volunteer committee for the 'global illumination: turning australian icons pink' and raising funds for breast cancer research and then in the corporate area, expanding the employee giving program and in a corporate relations role. she worked on the mt franklin campaign launch of 'think positive, drink positive' in 2008 and 2007, and was the face of mt franklin's full page print advertisement titled 'lessons learnt from breast cancer', which ran in national major women's magazines. amanda has shared her story as an nbcf speakers bureau ambassador since 2004, and now facilitates training workshops for new ambassadors before they embark on their public-speaking activities. my name's gretel. i'm 18 years old and am currently taking a gap year after graduating from school last year. i've deferred my degree of communications in journalism and international studies at uts to work half the year then travel to europe. i'm passionate about drama, music and travel. i also love hanging out with my friends whether it be over a glass of wine or swimming around at the beach. i'm supporting the national breast cancer foundation, because as a daughter and grand daughter of breast cancer survivors, i believe that investing money into quality research and educating young women about the illness is crucial, when so many families are affected by it.",3

1427,Philanthropy Australia," i will not mention others, but my point is simply to say this: the field evidence is very strong that people from both sides of politics have been very strongly supportive. on the other side of politics, outside this chamber, i commend john della bosca, a very skilful new south wales ex-labor minister and operative. he is an organisation man who has done an excellent job in helping to mobilise public opinion on and support for the scheme. it would be remiss not to say something about some of the people involved in the conception of the scheme: john walsh, a partner at pwc, who conceived it. it was progressed by bruce bonyhady, the president of philanthropy australia. i knew bruce bonyhady 20 or 30 years ago in the treasury. i think he was in the forecasting or modelling space. he is a rigorous thinker and he brought that rigour as well as his commitment to helping people with disability to the table. he has done a great job in further fleshing out the concept and helping to sell it.",4
437,Australian Institute of Petroleum," when you start joining the dots, it is not hard to work out what their real agenda is. peter mitchell is the current chairman of the waubra foundation. he is a current and former director of a number of oil, gas and uranium related companies—surprise, surprise! he is a director of lowell, who are basically the ultimate holding company of a resources fund for companies engaged entirely in mining and energy investment, including oil, gas and uranium. he is also the former director of the australian institute of petroleum ltd and molopo ltd, a company entirely investing in oil and gas. he was the founding public officer for the western plains landscape guardians. the landscape guardians are a group of people who object to wind on the basis of their impact on the landscape. that is a legitimate concern. some people do not like looking at wind turbines. beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but science is not in the eye of the beholder. whether wind turbine syndrome exists is a testable, objective fact. it has been tested and it does not exist. the science is in.",1
1498,Returned and Services League of Australia," (fadden) (17:21): the coalition welcomes the long overdue appointment of the anzac centenary advisory board. earlier this year, the leader of the opposition joined the shadow minister with responsibility in this area, senator the hon. michael ronaldson, to welcome the appointment of the former chief of the defence force, air chief marshal angus houston ac, afc (rtd) as the inaugural chairman of the board. it is a little disappointing that it has taken the minister for veterans' affairs more than three months to announce air chief marshal houston's 20 fellow board members, including the four ex-officio members: notably, the secretary of the department of veterans' affairs, the vice chief of the defence force, the president of the returned and services league of australia and the high commissioner of new zealand.",1

304,Australian Dental Association," this $515.3 million package includes $345.9 million spent delivering services that will reduce the backlog on public dental waiting lists around the country. it includes other measures, such as workforce measures, relocation and infrastructure grants to encourage dentists to relocate and practice in remote areas, oral health promotion and other very important measures. this will be vital for the 30 per cent of australians who cannot currently access the dental care they need. it is proof that good economic management is not in opposition to strong social objectives. indeed, it has been very well received by people in the health community, including the australian dental association president, dr shane fryer, who said:",3
1334,National Farmers' Federation," there are two things which i think are very important to point out about this piece of legislation. the first is the consultation which has taken place to ensure that this piece of legislation does the job that the industries on the ground want it to do. it is worth pointing out that, during the drafting phase of the bill, the department of agriculture established an industry legislation working group. the group consisted of 16 representatives, including the invasive species council, the national farmers federation, shipping australia, qantas, and the custom brokers and forwarders association.",4

1455,Private Healthcare Australia," the explanatory memorandum to this bill states that at present over 99.9 per cent of rebate claims are made through the premium reduction scheme, prs, and tax offset claiming, leaving very few rebate claims done through the incentive payment scheme. this figure has been confirmed by organisations in the private health insurance industry—such as private healthcare australia, which has said that a limited number of people will be affected by this change.",3
703,Australian Veterinary Association,"—i thank the member for calare for bringing this private members' business forward today. the work of our veterinarians in our country is really quite pervasive, from the care of our pampered pooches to the vital work on the front lines of maintaining australia's biosecurity at our export meatworks. as the member for calare has noted, the world's first veterinary school was founded in the french city of lyon in 1761. this means that 2011 is the 250th world anniversary of veterinary education and in itself the official creation of the veterinary profession. i note that international observations have already begun at versailles and will continue throughout the year. already, according to the vet2011.org website, there are almost 280 events planned across the globe and, dare i say, i expect there will be many more veterinary celebrations held throughout the year on this side of the world. this includes three particularly important events in australia, one of which is the australian veterinary association's annual conference, which is to be held in adelaide from 15 may.",1

916,Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia," prior to introducing tobacco plain-packaging legislation the australian government committed to consult broadly. the consultation process was administered by the department of health and ageing. during the consultation doha met with representatives of the tobacco industry on a number of occasions to discuss issues of concern. doha also met with a number of retail organisations, including the council of small business organisations of australia, the australian newsagents association, master grocers australia, the service station owners' association, the tobacco station group, the national independent retailers association and the two major supermarket chains: coles and woolworths. there are many small businesses and business associations who felt that the consultation process was poor and that they did not have enough time or opportunity to present or submit to this inquiry or to doha. the outcome of the doha consultation was described as follows:",4
780,Brain Injury Australia," independent advocacy for people with disability will only become more important as the ndis rollout continues. organisations like blind citizens australia, brain injury australia and deaf australia and peak bodies like the australian federation of disability organisations and disability advocacy network australia have dedicated years to protecting the rights and upholding the interests of australians with disability. we commend and salute them today and every day.",4

1618,Taxpayers Australia," around the time frame, the taxpayers australia group considered the levy's implementation period was too short to make a real contribution to 'budget repair'. the submission it gave to the relevant committee contended that the levy will end right at the time that government spending measures will be particularly high and need some support. in the submission that they gave they said: taxpayers australia have made similar comments. they have been known to say that 'only the wealthy but poorly advised' will be paying the debt tax, and i repeat that: only the wealthy but poorly advised will be paying the debt tax. taxpayers australia contend that the treasury's projection for raising $3.1 billion over three years may well be overstated as: taxpayers australia contend that tax agents are already out there advising the wealthy how to avoid this tax anyway. they are telling people to accelerate tax receipts or tax deductible expenditures into years where the tax relief is available or the levy is not active. they are also advising their clients on deferring tax into those years as well and also exploiting the misalignment between the financial and fringe benefit tax years through salary packaging programs. the people who are supposedly going to be hit by this levy are also the ones who have access to the kind of information they need to avoid paying it in the first place. that is how the rich get richer. that is how they do it. they are also increasing contributions to superannuation funds, which will continue to be taxed at 15 per cent, and so are reducing their taxable income below the level at which the levy will kick in.",3

357,Australian Forest Products Association," i will be supporting this bill but i do have serious and significant reservations about the whole concept of cost recovery. i note that minister joyce and his office have been very supportive in addressing particular concerns i have had about matters relating to this bill. in particular, i have had representations from ross hampton, the ceo of the australian forest products association, and from gavin matthew, the manager of processing, and there have been some useful and fruitful discussions with the department and with the minister's office in respect of those representations. the minister and the department have now agreed to hold off on applying tonnage charges to the forestry industry until a review of the proposed fee application has been completed. i would like to take this opportunity to table a letter from the minister outlining this agreement. it was a letter received from the minister this morning. it is undated but it is a letter that was prepared this morning. i seek leave of the senate to table that letter.",4
922,Cricket Australia," i want to in particular say thank you very much to cricket australia for the support that they have provided to the players within the team but also the broader cricket community, including the support staff as well. these are people that travel together. they are a very tight-knit group of people—the players, the support staff and the team at cricket australia. the fact is that they have been very conscious of the emotion which is still raw within the australian cricket team. to delay the playing schedule is a significant undertaking, but they have done that with a great level of professionalism, and i congratulate james sutherland and his team for the way in which they have been able to provide that support. they have demonstrated ably how they have been able to accommodate those players by delaying the brisbane test and rejigging the playing calendar with india across this summer. full credit to them.",1
59,Apple and Pear Australia," in answer to the trade minister's call to tap asia for farm funding, the national farmers federation demanded more policies to boost productivity and strengthen the economy to help farmers rise to the production challenge. this is the appropriate response. the nff is correct. tonight in parliament house representatives of apple and pear australia ltd will be here to present their wares and give an update on the state of their industry, an industry forgotten and, indeed, rebuffed by this government, which allowed new zealand apples, despite the obvious and serious risks of fire blight, to enter our markets for the first time in 90 years last august. as the shadow minister for agriculture and food security—and i am glad that he is here at the table listening to this—said: the labor government needs to show it is serious about research and development by supporting programs such as the aussie apple accord. labor passed a number of resolutions at its national conference last november which focused on research and development for increasing the sustainable production of more food. apple and pear australia has unveiled a multimillion dollar aussie apple accord to prepare the industry for the future with innovation to improve quality and productivity, and this program meets the criteria of labor's resolutions. given this and the fact that labor is supposedly serious about agriculture and improving r&d, minister ludwig should support the aussie apple accord and give the industry the government's backing.",3
711,Australian Water Association," recently, the new south wales government has announced that they are removing their water commissioner and collapsing the new south wales office of water with the metropolitan water directorate. concurrently, we have seen the new south wales chief scientist & engineer claim that filtration of water in the sydney catchment area would suffice to make the water safe for drinking, while at the same time noting that there is 'limited data to analyse the cumulative impact of mining activities in the area'. the independent new south wales scientific committee's 2005 listing of longwall coal mining as a key threatening process affecting surface and ground water hydrology receives nary a mention anywhere—surely, given the level of concern around water and mining issues, the removal of specialist independent oversight of water policy is a mistake. the national farmers' federation says we need an alternative. the australian water association says it is short-sighted. and i would say it is outright negligent.",3
89,Association of Independent Retirees,"—in light of it being seniors week next week, i would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge an important organisation which i have had the opportunity to meet with on a number of occasions. along with the member for tangney, i was invited just last week to their 10-year anniversary celebrations held at the willeton sports club. the organisation is the association of independent retirees perth southern districts branch. the theme of the anniversary was to thank federal and state governments for their support over the past 10 years. i was asked to speak on behalf of the federal opposition. i congratulate all the members of the association of independent retirees perth southern districts branch, including their president mr charles o'donnell, national president ms theresa kot and foundation member diane blades, for reaching their 10-year milestone.",1
1415,Palliative Care Australia," (tasmania—deputy government whip in the senate) (22:20): the introduction of contemporary palliative care services, not just in tasmania but across australia, is a cause i have been wholly committed to supporting. recently in launceston we held a public forum to help people in our community understand what is meant by palliative care and to gather more support for the cause. the forum was a suggestion that arose from a meeting between the friends of northern hospice and palliative care foundation and me in late 2011. the forum was a cooperative venture organised by friends of northern hospice and palliative care foundation, calvary health and me. the forum coincided with palliative care week. this was one of two activities during palliative care week of the friends of northern hospice and palliative care foundation. the other was a remembrance ceremony on the sunday. i would like to add how supportive palliative care australia was of the activities held across the country.",3
1327,National Disability Services," but, whether it is through losing the genetic lottery at birth or whether it is by a terrible piece of bad luck and acquiring a disability later in life, we need a better system of support across australia. that is why i believe the ndis is so important. so i am deeply disappointed by the decision of some members of the labor party to attack this motion during their speeches in the house earlier today. i believe they have made a terrible error of judgment. this is an opportunity for this parliament and this government to rise above the day-to-day pettiness of politics and deliver some ground-breaking reform. it will take men and women of good faith on both sides of the chamber to deliver the reform and to give it the funding that is desperately required. the disability sector knows that. i refer members to the statement this morning by dr ken baker, chief executive of national disability services. in his statement today, dr baker said:",3
622,Australian Services Union," the sector believes that they are $500 million short. that is across 316 organisa­tions. nevertheless, the organisations did receive some wage supplementation—$440 million—from the queensland government. in some cases it was referred to as 'money to meet increased costs'. it was not put to them as money to meet the requirements of this change, nor were they told why each organisation got the money they did. in fact there are a number of organisations that are not on the prescribed list that believe they should be. there are organisations on the prescribed list who believe they should not be. no-one knows where the list came from, and there was no consultation whatsoever by the bligh government with the stakeholders. the only consultation undertaken by the australian government was with the queensland labor government, the depart­ment of community services and the union involved, the australian services union. so, i guess we should not be surprised at this. i am trying to give you a picture of what a disaster this is creating.",4
798,Business Council of Australia," i am asked about the support that we have received for the china-australia free trade agreement. the wonderful work done in advocacy by the minister for trade and investment has brought a lot of people out in support of the china-australia free trade agreement, especially because of the risk that labor pose to it and to the economy; groups like the national farmers' federation, the business council of australia, the australian chamber of commerce and industry, and small-business representative organisations across australia. ",3
694,Australian Trucking Association,"there are some specific ideas canvassed there: local planning laws to prevent urban encroachment on vital road and rail corridors, establishing dedicated freight routes, separating passenger trains from freight trains, more intermodals to improve access to rail and using smart infrastructure to get more productivity out of the infrastructure which is there at the moment, as well as moving to single national regulators in rail, heavy vehicle and maritime. at the moment we have 23 transport regulators for australia's 22 million people. we will move that to three and the prime minister advanced that process at the recent coag meeting. it has been endorsed by the australian logistics council, the australian trucking association, the australian food and grocery council, infrastructure partnerships australia, engineers australia, the western sydney regional organisation of councils and many other industry organisations in the last 24 hours. there has been one area of opposition, and we know who that will be.",3
1678,Vision Australia," australia will also continue to increase our assistance to civil society organisations, including non-government organisations, where they are effective and provide the best delivery mechanism to achieve results. in addition to increased funding, reforms to our ngo program include high-level strategic partnerships between ausaid and some of australia's largest ngos, including world vision australia, oxfam australia, caritas australia, plan international australia and child fund australia. the government intends to double the ausaid ngo coop­eration program, the ancp, which will support more australian non-government organisations to participate in the overall delivery of the aid program.",666
1334,National Farmers' Federation," the first amendment will ensure that state and territory decision-makers must seek and take into account the advice of the iesc. this is achieved by making it compulsory for bilateral agreements to include this requirement. secondly, we will allow the environment minister to request advice from the iesc about the operation of a bilateral agreement in relation to the water trigger. this could include advice on the extent to which the state or territory has assessed the impacts and consequences of the development and considered the initial advice of the iesc. the minister for the environment has consulted with nsw farmers, the national farmers' federation, and the queensland and new south wales governments—because that is what this side of government does. that is what the federal coalition does. we consult. we never heard any consultation from those on the other side in the last six years—particularly in the last term when there was a hung parliament, and particularly when it came down to issues which affected farmland, agriculture, and regional and rural australia. all we ever saw—all we ever heard from them—was what the member for melbourne wanted. we had this green tinge placed over every bit of legislation. and did we ever hear from the member for richmond about wanting to get her electorate going forward—about her electorate actually looking at things, in relation to weighing up industry as well as the environment, and reaching a satisfactory conclusion? no, we did not. that is why i commend the member for page for his amendments.",4
1102,Greening Australia," we visited the grassy hut site and received briefings from greening australia and the tasmanian land conservancy. we received very important information covering a range of issues such as revegetation, threats to the region and mitigation of threats. we visited the central plateau and saw the pencil pines. we saw how there had been changes in the subalpine area above 800 metres and what this has meant for those pines. we inspected some pencil pines near pine lake boardwalk and received briefings from the dpipwe officers on the threats to that species.

310,Australian Diagnostic Imaging Association," (ballarat) (14:37): my question is to the prime minister. according to the australian diagnostic imaging association, the prime minister's decision to abolish bulk-billing incentives will mean general patients who are previously bulk-billed will now pay upfront costs of up to $2,207 for a liver metastasis diagnosis. why is the prime minister determined to destroy medicare and slug australians more to have their liver metastasis diagnosed?",3

917,Council of Textile and Fashion Industries of Australia," these savings were announced in the budget, and i note that when i last checked with the minister's office he had received no negative feedback or concern from any stakeholder group since the announcement, so i would have thought this would have been a fairly uncontroversial measure that would save the budget bottom line some money and contribute towards balancing the budget. in my electorate there is a lady who has created a series of textile, clothing and footwear organisations, and she has not contacted me or, it seems, the government, to express any opinion on the changes. many of her activities now have an overseas focus so i would suggest that the businesses are becoming more adjusted to the tariff reductions and more focused on the opportunities of international trade. current projects on her website seem to focus on chennai, india and hong kong. i also note that, when i last checked, there had been no comment or public statement on the website of the council of textile and fashion industries of australia.",1
861,Clean Up Australia," as i said, it is a vastly overwhelming problem. but, when you look at the shearwater, and the studies that are coming in on the damage that this plastic is doing to our ocean, we do need to start somewhere. we do have a responsibility, not only at a bureaucratic level and as joe citizen cleaning beaches and getting out for clean up australia day but also as parliamentarians who can put in place product stewardship schemes that address this issue and go directly to the source of taking plastics out of our ocean, allowing the shearwater and their chicks— (time expired)",1
152,Australian Aluminium Council," (warringah—leader of the opposition) (14:05): my question is to the prime minister. i refer her to the government's intention to give the alcoa aluminium smelter at point henry $42 million in hush money to help pay its carbon tax bill. given that the australian aluminium council has warned that the carbon tax will contribute to ensuring australian aluminium operations have no long-term future, will the prime minister now announce similar bailouts for all the other 16,000 workers in the industry at sites like gladstone, portland, kwinana, kurri kurri and bell bay?",3
672,Australian Subscription Television and Radio Association," the bill reflects recent developments. i am very pleased that, on 1 may this year, an agreement on the targets for increased captioning levels across existing subscription television channels and minimum captioning levels for new channels was finalised by the australian human rights commission and the australian subscription television and radio association, so the agreement was taken into account when developing the new legislative requirements in the bill.",4
1427,Philanthropy Australia," philanthropy australia was one of the participants in the hearing that was most recently convened here in parliament, just a couple of weeks ago. we heard from mr david ward of philanthropy australia. this was his assessment of the current regulatory regime that those opposite seek to uphold and continually seem to argue is quite adequate for the job—despite the fact that senator brett mason, i think, actually articulated very clearly what the threat of doing nothing in this sector is. david ward said:",3
1495,Restaurant and Catering Australia," i want to congratulate the people involved in making this happen, particularly american express, who have really gotten behind this campaign and have put their weight and power behind, it in partnership with a range of organisations, such as little tiny organisations like google, qantas, energy australia and myob, just to name a few. industry groups such as acci, aha and restaurant and catering australia were also involved. they all came to the table on this to be able to demonstrate that, if you want small business to succeed, you need to support them. if you want the country to succeed, you need to support small business. if you want people to have more jobs and grow the economy, then you can start by supporting your local small businesses. i would encourage everyone listening to do exactly the same thing in their own small way.",4

343,Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations," (tasmania) (19:37): tonight i rise to speak on an event called hopak in the park, which i attended at melbourne's sidney myer music bowl in april. the event was organised by the australian federation of ukrainian organisations, or afuo. i had the privilege of speaking on behalf of the government at this event, and i was also attending in my new role as chair of the australia-ukraine federal parliamentary group. the inaugural hopak in the park, a dance spectacular, was an opportunity to celebrate ukrainian culture and the relationship between ukraine and australia. over 300 participants from bands and dance groups from across australia were enthusiastic to showcase their dance, music and costumes in the traditional ukrainian way. participants included second-, third- and even fourth-generation ukrainians who are dedicated to australia but still remain true to their ukrainian origins. the australian participants were joined by hrim, a ukrainian band from new york, and it was wonderful to have an international act as part of the event. i have a close association with ukraine, as my husband, robert, who attended the event with me, is of ukrainian descent. this has led me to take a strong interest in ukraine and its culture, although i have not yet had the pleasure of visiting the country. hopak in the park is a cultural event of national significance. it is a chance for ukrainians in australia to share their culture with each other and the broader community. i take this opportunity to give a bit of brief information about australia's relationship with the ukraine. the first permanent ukrainian settler in australia was h donchak, who settled in brisbane in the 1920s. the 1940s, of course, was an important decade for ukrainian settlement in australia, with the arrival of many ukrainians following world war ii, and that included my own father-in-law. april 1949 saw the formation of the first ukrainian association in south australia, with other states following later in the year and in 1950, and in june 1950 a representative body for all ukrainian organisations in australia was founded. this body was called the association of ukrainians in australia and was renamed the australian federation of ukrainian organisations in december 1953. according to the latest census, in 2006 there were 13,666 people living in australia who were born in ukraine. it is estimated that the ukrainian community in australia is somewhere between 30,000 and 50,000 strong. of course, my home state of tasmania has a small but very important population of ukrainians and their descendants. all the communities make a very valuable contribution to australian society. i would like to take the time tonight to thank the organisers of hopak in the park for their efforts in keeping ukrainian culture alive and vibrant in australia. as we all know, an event as big as this requires a lot of people with a common goal to work together to make it a success, and it certainly does not happen overnight. everyone deserves to be congratulated for their hard work and dedication to the event. there are too many people to mention them all, but there are a few i really would like to mention: the two masters of ceremonies, yuliya rai and steven sikoria; the manager of the sidney myer music bowl, the arts centre, glen hirst; and, of course, the performers and backstage people essential to the event going ahead. i would like to acknowledge the efforts of the australian federation of ukrainian organisations and other organisations concerned with taking a leadership role and encouraging members of australia's ukrainian community to be active in community life. i would like to thank them for enriching the experience of australians by sharing their culture with us. i would also like to thank the sponsors of the event: myroslaw and christine merunovich, the australian federation of ukrainian organisations, karpaty foundation, the national lubomyr sklepkowycz foundation, the victorian multicultural commission, adel bassili from travelwiz, dnister credit union, event management services, the foundation of ukrainian studies in australia; the supporters, muirs good guys; and those who donated raffle prizes, including inter airlines consolidated group, thai airways, travelwiz, the good guys discount warehouses in essendon, portobello restaurant in essendon, and north essendon lotto in essendon. their generosity was much appreciated.",1
625,Australian Shareholders' Association," the house standing committee on economics, of which i am privileged to be a member, held an inquiry into the bill on 12 september 2011. we heard witnesses from the treasury, asic, the australian securities exchange, chi-x, the stockbrokers association of australia, rbs morgans, the australian shareholders association and the australian financial markets association. the inquiry was a comprehensive one and went to the overall goal, which is to make australia a financial centre.",4
603,Australian Retailers Association," (victoria—minister for broadband, communications and the digital economy, deputy leader of the government in the senate and minister assisting the prime minister on digital productivity) (14:12): this morning minister sherry and i launched driving business online, an exciting new initiative to help small businesses establish an online presence and to enable them to transact online. driving business online is an educational program that is being developed by paypal and partnered by ebay, australia post, optus, myob, powerfront, symantec and the australian retailers association.",1
269,Australian Conservation Foundation," i also mention groups like micah challenge, who have taken the very import­ant step of recognising the importance of climate in abolishing global property, groups like oxfam, who have also taken the lead, and, of course, the australian conservation foundation and climate action groups all around the country who have played such an important part of bringing this campaign forward. i pay particular tribute to matthew wright and the team from beyond zero emissions for showing us that it can be done. maybe the model for a 100 per cent renewable australia will not be precisely as they have proposed, but they have taken the bold step of just doing the engineering work that should really have been done by state and federal governments and of putting a serious challenge on the table in front of policy makers to say: 'the engineers and the technologists say this can be done. over to you, policy makers—make it happen.' in wa the folks at sustainable energy now, a wonderful group of engineers and energy advocates, have simply done what western australian energy authorities should have done a long time ago: come up with a model for how to get to 100 per cent in western australia on the south-west integrated system. it is a superb piece of work and it deserves to be resourced.",4

932,Cystic Fibrosis Australia," (mitchell) (09:54): in late november 2012, i was honoured to open and welcome the new national office of cystic fibrosis australia into the electorate of mitchell and the norwest business park. it was fantastic to meet with the national president, mitch messer, and the national ceo, david jack, and all of the state presidents and ceos of cystic fibrosis australia. it was an exciting gathering and it was fantastic to welcome this dynamic institution into my community. as members would know, cystic fibrosis is an inherited recessive genetic condition. if two people are genetic carriers for cystic fibrosis and they have a child, there is a great chance that the child will have cystic fibrosis. the national body supports people with cystic fibrosis by delivering a range of programs including information and knowledge, research, advocacy, quality improvement in health care, awareness and understanding, and national leadership. investment last year in these areas totalled in excess of $1.2 million, with over $500,000 invested in research. it is, once again, amazing to see an institution like this national body operate without government funding and achieve great things, purely on the basis of citizens' contributions and business and other contributions. at the launch, after meeting with the presidents and hearing from them, it was time to launch the national data registry. in 1996, cystic fibrosis australia decided to set up a national data registry. over the next two years, all aspects of developing the data registry were explored and a model released in '98. this model is something that the minister for health and the department of health and ageing could take a good look at for use in other areas. this national data registry is a way of ensuring that all of the data from the patient experience is captured from all of the individual cystic fibrosis centres in australia. the data registry report is very effective. it highlights some of the progress that is being made, and it could provide a good model for application in other diseases and other areas. using the data from these centres in australia, the primary aim of the register is to monitor the disease, but it also tells us, after a decade of reports, where progress has been made and where disease trends are changing. an accurate and adequately funded data registry is an essential information source for any group or organisation seeking to provide accurate information, education and research resources. it will help ensure that limited and scarce government funds and community funds are being spent in the right direction. it was a great privilege to launch the 2012 and 2013 cystic fibrosis data registry report. it is a great honour to have cystic fibrosis australia join us in mitchell, but i congratulate them on the great work that they are doing nationally. on behalf of all of the mitchell community, i welcome them and wish them all the very best for their future endeavours.",4
248,Australian Coal Association," there are differences that exist as well. the european union scheme, for all that it is held up as the grand design, does not capture such things as fugitive emissions, unlike the australian scheme. the australian coal association argued that in the eu the majority of permits have been, and continue to be, allocated without charge to the traded sector during a lengthy transitional period. the linkage with the eu ets highlights the disadvantage imposed on australian producers.",3
446,Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees'," firstly, it is deeply anticompetitive to say we will put into the legislation a criterion that the big funds can automatically meet and that the small funds are at a systemic disadvantage in meeting. it is hardly surprising in this context that the scale test has been pushed by the industry super network, the lobby group that represents large industry funds such as australian super. again, i remind the house it was a predecessor organisation of australian super that the present minister for financial services and superannuation was formerly a director of. i also remind the house that two other members of the parliamentary labor party, the minister for climate change and senator doug cameron, were also former directors of australian super. in other words, there is a real concern that the policy agenda of the big funds is being pursued by this government. it is interesting that the australian institute of superannuation trustees, which represents the trustees of super funds across the board including industry super funds, is opposed to the scale test. they told the joint parliamentary committee:",3
1495,Restaurant and Catering Australia," (western australia) (21:51): i want to continue on with a speech that i started last week looking at the abbott government's desire to get rid of penalty rates. last week, i drew links between the north sydney forum, john hart from the association restaurant and catering australia and mr joe hockey. as we know, mr hockey wrote the terms of reference of the productivity commission's inquiry. this week, i want to continue my remarks around penalty rates, but really look at penalty rates from a workers' perspective.",1
588,Australian Psychological Society," in relation to end-user notices, the australian psychological society pointed out that developmental research supports an educational and restorative approach to cyberbullying rather than one that is punitive. this means the legal framework should aim to prevent rather than punish, and promote diversionary programs rather than fines for young offenders. as i mentioned briefly earlier in this contribution, there were some doubts expressed about the effectiveness of the proposed regime. the australian psychological society questioned the evidence base for implementing the system and proposed rigorous evaluation of the process and impact.",3
1223,Legacy Australia," one of the important messages i have received from legal experts at the office of parliamentary counsel is that my private member's legislation does not breach any provisions of australia's constitution. therefore, anyone who says otherwise is simply trying to muddy the waters and let the abbott government off the hook with regard to its appalling management of the defence pay crisis. the national ex-service organisations, made up of the australian peacekeeper and peacemaker veterans association, the australian federation of totally and permanently incapacitated ex servicemen and women, the australian special air service association, the defence force welfare association, the legacy australia council, the naval association of australia, the partners of veterans association of australia, the royal australian air force association, the royal australian regiment corporation, the vietnam veterans' association of australia, the vietnam veterans federation of australia and the war widows' guild of australia,have released a media statement which offers extraordinary criticism of this defence minister and his government. they did not make this statement, as the attorney-general would have you believe, because of a slip of the tongue. they have put out these damaging statements because of a prolonged period of dysfunction and incompetent management of the defence and veterans' affairs departments.",3
1466,Prosper Australia,,666
1636,The Foundation for Young Australians," i acknowledge that the foundation for young australians was funded by the previous government over four years from 2013 with the purpose of delivering the safe schools coalition australia program. i understand that in queensland no one admits to using it in their schools and in victoria it is compulsory—or it will be—but i am very pleased that the federal minister has contacted his state counterparts, saying that he expects that schools choosing to take part in the program will do so in consultation with parents and the school community and also that all material is age-appropriate and that parents have confidence in any resources used in a school to support the right of all students, staff and families to feel safe at school.",1
840,Children with Disability Australia,"to ensure that we hear from carers across the country, the australian government has provided $175,000 to carers australia and children with disability australia to run discussion forums with carers and to seek their views and ideas for the national carer strategy. we will consult directly with carer organisations, advocates and service providers across all capital cities and selected rural and remote areas. the carer strategy will be a 10-year agenda to support carers, to drive reform and to guide policy development and delivery of services for carers.",4
801,Butterfly Foundation," the national eating disorders collaboration estimates that around one in 20 australians has an eating disorder, and it is a rate that is increasing. in fact, between 1995 and 2005, the prevalence of eating disorders doubled among both males and females. we are seeing an increase in hospital admissions for treatment of children under 10 years old with disordered eating behaviours. the butterfly foundation has reported that calls for help to their support line increased 200 per cent in 2013. while we sometimes hear a lot about these issues, we as a community need a greater understanding of what it is we are really facing.",3
307,Australian Diabetes Council," i also acknowledge my constituents kenneth shepherd and sarah pyke for their work as members of the australian diabetes council. both mr shepherd and miss pyke have highlighted to me the challenges faced by people with diabetes, including the need for access to essential services. miss pyke is insulin dependant and required four injections every day. both mr shepherd and miss pyke have conveyed to me that access to health professionals and good management of diabetes can prevent complications and help people with diabetes to live long and healthy lives. and there are scores of other constituents who have contacted me in recent weeks who have brought their own stories of type 1 diabetes to my attention. although time does not permit me to name you all individually today, i acknowledge each of you and your commitment and advocacy.",3

1021,Federation of Automotive Products Manufacturers," by leave—i want to thank the members of the committee, those being senator glen lazarus and fellow colleagues butler, carr, husic, pitt, porter, reynolds, seselja and wilkie and also the groups that made substantial contributions to this report, which looked into assisting rural and manufacturing industries in crisis and supporting communities that are affected by natural disasters—in particular, the national farmers' federation, the australian prawn farmers association, oysters australia, queensland farmers federation, ausveg limited, regional development australia, australian dairy farmers, graingrowers, amwu, the federation of automotive products manufacturers and the rural business development corporation.",4

748,Barnardos Australia," i acknowledge and thank the following organisations for their support of the children and their foster carers: lutanda camp toukley, life without barriers, barnardos australia, the salvation army, catholiccare, challenge community services, nsw family and community services, northlakes toukley rotary; children's services, connecting carers nsw, wesley dalmar, house with no steps and phoenix rising for children. to each and every one of these organisations, i thank them for their commitment to our community on the central coast in assisting foster carers and the foster carers' families. they do a wonderful job. to all foster carers, thank you for everything you do for these kids.",2
1370,National Union of Students," it is a great day for all those in the labor ranks who worked their way up through the radical student wing of the alp, who spent their youth protesting this or that while others bothered to work hard and attend classes. it is a great day for that bastion of anti-semitism and bias, the national union of students, who know their profligate ways and days of big spending are about to return. indeed, one labor staffer was seen crowing today on facebook that this legislation represented the first step on the march to universal compulsory unionism, and that is what this is all about for the labor party—an unbridled commitment to the socialist collective and the destruction of individual choice and freedom. myth no. 4: student life suffers because student unions do not have enough money to fund clubs and societies on campus. fact: it would seem that whenever student politicians are given the chance to fund either clubs or societies on campus or fund political activities they invariably choose to fund their political activities instead. i highlight the university of melbourne union that recently reported that it was forced to cut the clubs and societies budget by $18,000 so that it could afford to pay an extra $15,000 to the national union of students.",1
1315,National Basketball League," (herbert) (10:46): thank you, deputy speaker scott; i know you will be hanging on this. to the townsville fire team, congratulations to all concerned. the second grand final in the women's national basketball league in a row. we will travel to bendigo—i see the member opposite, the member for bendigo, is very keen to see the townsville fire in bendigo again—this weekend where this time we will go all the way. we will beat bendigo. the whole city is behind coach, chris lucas; our captain, rachael mccully—she is no longer flanagan; suzy and all the girls. can i wish a very happy birthday, a special birthday, to assistant coach, former player and all round great girl, claudia brassard. claudia, for your birthday we got you a grand final. what you have to do from there is win the thing.",1
1334,National Farmers' Federation," what do the national farmers federation, a friend of the national party, have to say about it? let us put it on the record, because those opposite will not do it:",3
1487,Regional Aviation Association of Australia," it is no secret that carriers are finding it harder to obtain regional aircraft, which are no longer being built in the same numbers as they were in previous years. an obvious solution could be that regional carriers, through innovative financial measures, are encouraged to purchase larger aircraft with extra seats being used to stimulate tourism demand in rural, regional and remote communities. private sector expertise should be utilised so that leisure travellers, either as individuals or through travel agents, have the greatest possible access to flights through the establishment of regional aviation and tourism bookings websites. such a project should be led by the regional aviation association of australia, utilising the knowledge and expertise of individuals like jayson westbury, the ceo of australian federation of travel agents, and the hon. john sharpe, the former transport minister and current chairman of rex airlines.",1
1670,Urban Development Institute of Australia," had we been able to move amendments then, we would have moved the substantial amendments that are now being supported by the entire parliament. we would have done so with the support of the submissions that were made by the business council of australia, by the urban development institute of australia, by infrastructure partnerships australia and by anyone else who considered the implications of the original bill. the original bill that was brought before this parliament and gagged through this chamber would have taken away the independence of infrastructure australia. it provided for the minister to be able to exclude categories of infrastructure, and we on this side of the chamber had our fears about that realised when we looked at the may budget where funding for every single public transport project that was not under construction was removed from the federal budget. that included projects such as the cross river rail project and the melbourne metro project that were high on infrastructure australia's priority list. infrastructure australia has already been conducting rolling audits, with a list published at least annually, which has a pipeline of projects from projects that are ready to proceed right through to projects that show some promise but need more work to be done. cross river rail was at the very top of the june 2012 infrastructure australia priority list.",3
343,Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations," on sunday i joined the members of the community as a fellow catholic and as their mp for liturgy and to help commence getting rid of the graffiti. i congratulate the church's parish and the australian federation of ukrainian organisations for their positive and effective work in their community. this attempt to import conflicts from other countries to australia has rightly been condemned by all levels of government as heinous and abhorrent, as will other incidents of racially, ethnically and politically motivated vilification in australia's culturally diverse society, as they have and always should be.",2
807,CARE Australia,"i would also like to look also at the work being done by palliative care australia who are meeting in canberra today and, this very day, revising their position statement on euthanasia. they make the point that in fact requests to die, euthanasia, are in many ways simply a result of a failure to provide good and adequate palliative care. that is certainly something that we must change and must work on to improve.",3
1247,Master Builders Australia," as i said, these changes would apply at the federal level to federally registered trade unions and to federally registered employer organisations. by their breadth they are significant reforms. these have been done—and this is important to point out—in a very open way. the consultation itself has been conducted with industry associations and unions across the board. it has been done openly with peak employer bodies like the business council of australia, acci—the australian chamber of commerce and industry—master builders australia, ai group, the national farmers federation and the actu, all through the national workplace relations consultative council. this was a good approach, done openly and involving all groups; and again i make the point that those opposite cannot simply negotiate and consult one side of the equation and leave the others out. they cannot just talk to employers and fail to take into account employee concerns as well. we have tried to ensure that the breadth of consultation covers all views to try to balance those out. as the communique issued by the national workplace relations consultative council back on 25 may read:",4
912,Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations,"nigel palmer, from the council of australian postgraduate associations also informed the committee that “at the very least, having a national commission or a national ombudsman's office would be useful to give students a clear avenue for redress. even where students are unable to have their issues resolved by that office, at least there is a vehicle for national reporting on the kinds of problems that are coming up through the system and areas which may need to be addressed by government.”",3

622,Australian Services Union,"—my question is to the minister representing the minister for the status of women, senator wong. i refer to the heads of agreement signed in 2009 by the now prime minister, julia gillard, and the australian services union, in which labor committed to support the asu's test case on pay equity for community sector employees. following labor's recent backflip on support for the asu test case, isn't labor's abandonment of low-paid women workers in the community sector yet another example of labor making promises to win an election and then betraying the very people it promised?",1
1668,Universities Australia,"in this spirit, i would like to record my appreciation for the participation of universities australia, the council of private higher education, tafe directors australia, the australian council for private education and training, the national tertiary education union, the council of australian postgraduate associations and the national union of students in contributing to the development of the legislation and associated standards.",4
580,Australian Private Equity and Venture Capital Association," the committee also received submissions outlining similar concerns from large and reputable organisations such as the australian private equity and venture capital association, rsm bird cameron and the business and industry advisory committee to the oecd. i note that the passage of the bill was of sufficient interest that the embassy trade adviser of at least one of our major trading nations was present at the hearing, with a view to identifying issues for his nation's businesses operating in australia.",3
812,Carers Australia,"when we were in government we particularly understood, as i said before, the significant problem for young carers. on 24 june 2009 carers australia released the final report from the bring it! young carers forum 2008. that report highlighted key messages and directions for the future that they hoped would assist young carers to identify care, study, work and access support.",3
245,Australian Christian Lobby," the other way that this is unfortunately being hijacked is that it is now being aggressively pushed as an anti-freedom of speech issue. the campaign has depended on first driving alternative voices out of the debate by public demonisation and then filling it with a range of disinformation. the terms 'extremist', 'hater', 'bigot' and 'propagators of hate' are some of the labels used in the media recently against the australian christian lobby and against other supporters of marriage. how is it that the debate has degenerated to such standards of speech? victoria's deputy chief psychiatrist, professor kuruvilla george, was forced to resign as commissioner on the victorian equal opportunity and human rights commission because he participated in a submission to the senate's inquiry which supported retaining the definition of marriage. there were calls by numerous gay activists for tennis great margaret court's name to be removed from an arena at the melbourne tennis centre because of her disagreement over same-sex marriage. the acl submission to the senate inquiry documents numerous other cases around the world of freedom of speech on this debate being infringed.",1
1691,Wilderness Society,"i do not think that the wild rivers act 2005 was provided with any mischief. i do not think that the queensland government said, 'how can we take rights off people?' that was not the case at all. in fact, this particular piece of legislation, as sometimes happens in this place, was not actually provided by the queensland government; it was actually a function of the wilderness society. the wilderness society have obviously decided that they need this piece of legislation to either sell a brand or do whatever it is. they are pretty keen on this legislation. if you want any detail on this legislation, do not go to the queensland government because i do not think they will be able to give you direct answers about what the motive was. the wilderness society will have every rag and detail of this and i will speak about their full involvement in a moment. i have visited aurukun and spoken to many of the people in that area about the aurukun wetlands. the archer river basin wild river declaration was gazetted on 3 april 2009. traditional owners were absolutely astounded to find out after going through some consultation—which was rare on the wild rivers stuff, but actually happened in this case—that the queensland government declared all of the aurukun wetlands as part of it. that was not included in the process of consultation. it is a mystery as to why that happened. but the freedom of information material later revealed that the wetlands that were not consulted on or talked about were included on the basis of a submission from our old mates the wilderness society. in the same way as the greens are shackled to this government, with this government being dragged around by the greens, the queensland government are in complete thrall in this matter to the wilderness society. outside of the process, with no respect given to indigenous people, it is: 'oh, by the way: can you just stick this in there? i know we haven't told the owners about it, but we think it'd be a nice colour to have on the map.' it is an absolute outrage. support for this legislation today will right that wrong. let us be very clear about the position of the queensland government, the australian greens—i hope that you change your mind, senator siewert—and the wilderness society particularly. they all have comments on the record which substantiate what i am about to say. their position is that somehow, as a part of aboriginal land conservation, we should not only conserve the land but them, too. their position is that aboriginal people should be frozen in time, perhaps standing on one leg, so that when the tourists come and see the wonderful biodiversity the aboriginal people are part of it. they want to make sure that aboriginal people do not have the same opportunities as others. the wilderness society would say, 'we have saved this area.' i am not sure what from, but they say that they have saved this area. i remind all those in this place that the land is in a pristine condition. and it will remain in that pristine condition, not because of the wilderness society or the labor party or the queensland government but because of the fantastic work of aboriginals in that area since colonisation. they were the ones who kept this land pristine. it is a slap in the face for those people from cape york to say, 'oh, they're all going to go and build some massive dams,' or one of these other weird fantasies that have been thrown up. i believe the prime minister when she says that she is very serious about empowering aboriginal australians. in the paper today, i note that it says that she is going to alice springs. i hope that she takes the opportunity to go with my leader to send a signal to australia that this is important enough for bipartisanship. i would also like the prime minister to understand that supporting this legislation is absolutely essential to ensure that we are sending a signal to all australians that we are fair dinkum about giving aboriginal people the same access and equity that non-aboriginal people enjoy. throw away the shackles of the green movement ; throw away the shackles of the wilderness society and stand up for australians, and particularly stand up for our first australians.",3

102,Asthma Australia," i support the member for shortland's motion on asthma. she and i are co-chairs of the parliamentary friends of asthma. i join with her in congratulating asthma australia for their proactive and consistent advocacy for asthma awareness and laud them for their work in developing an understanding of asthma, its effects and its treatments. asthma is a massively prevalent condition in australia. it affects almost one in every 10 australians. as the member for shortland noted in her motion, 2.3 million australians suffer from the condition of asthma, including yours truly. whilst asthma is a condition which affects many and is often quite mild, it can also be a condition that can prove fatal. astonishingly, asthma kills nearly 400 australians per year—or eight per week. asthma, like so many conditions, disproportionately affects the socially disadvantaged in our society, especially those who live below the poverty line—including, sadly, our aboriginal and torres strait islander peoples. asthma awareness is critical in assisting those suffering from this condition and it does save lives. the reality is that there is a knowledge deficit in the management of asthma attacks in this country. it is my hope, through motions such as this and the work of asthma australia and the national asthma council australia, that we can raise awareness. in raising awareness we will eliminate that deficit. ",4
105,Athletics Australia," the excuse for the reports is a claim that i was responsible for a misuse of public funds. this claim is baseless. firstly, i was not responsible for the payment or acquittal of money used to fund mr boldon's trip. athletics australia has confirmed that, in april 2010, mr bolden toured australia as an ambassador and mentor for the jump start to london program. athletics australia has confirmed that my role was establishing initial contact with mr boldon. athletics australia has also confirmed that it paid for mr boldon's return flights from los angeles to melbourne, his accommodation and reasonable expenses. athletics australia also says: this afternoon, the australian sports commission has said that the use of sports ambassadors for programs like this was common, and athletics australia has:",1
1514,Royal Institute for Deaf and Blind Children," the leones are a remarkable family who have not only opened their home to the general public but opened their hearts so that charities such as the royal institute for deaf and blind children, hart walkers, guide dogs and many others will benefit from their generosity and hospitality. over a two-day period, some 4,000 visitors walked through the east gate of the private home and were immediately transported into a place of tranquillity and colourful beauty, with classical music enhancing their senses. twice per year, 18,000 bedding annuals are planted to produce a rich tapestry of colour and texture. special features include transformation of the original horse area into an impressive fountain, life-size bronze sculptures, several water features, beautiful open spaces and manicured lawns, making it easier for families to enjoy their visit to this special place. like so many events held in my electorate, this event was well supported by some 50 volunteers drawn from the rotary club of the hills-kellyville, the rotary club of castle hill, the inner wheel club of baulkham hills and lantern ladies from the royal institute for deaf and blind children. the volunteers worked tirelessly to cater for the large crowd. over $20,000 was raised in two days in support of these charities. like so many other families in my electorate, the leone family are stalwarts of the community who look beyond their own circumstances to encompass the lives of others. this recent event marked the fourth time the leone family have opened their garden for charity, and they have so far raised over half a million dollars. some things change in our world, but the pride and the community spirit of the leone family are a great example to all of us.",1

1467,Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia," there are still many more lives yet to be saved, with 17,000 new cases each year and over 3,000 men dying. there is so much more work to be done. the good news is that survival rates are going up dramatically. that is largely a result of the great work of people like professor tony costello, phil stricker and others, and the prostate cancer foundation of australia. they have been so successful not only in raising awareness but also in the technological advances that have come through robotics and many other achievements. i will finish by saying that in government we established the prostate centres as part of our comprehensive approach to making sure that men survive prostate cancer.

858,Civil Contractors Federation, we can only conclude that the payment was designed to pad premier napthine's budget bottom line in advance of the victorian state election. we should also never forget that this favour to a political mate came at a time when the government claimed it was facing a budget emergency. so much for the budget emergency—making advance payments years in advance of any construction. that compares with what the assistant minister told the civil contractors federation—and the minister may well remember this. on 6 june he said:,1
1033,Finance Sector Union of Australia," i want to pay tribute to the numbers of women and men in the union movement who have maintained the pressure through our domestic violence reporting process, through the processes within the actu and through the labor national conference to ensure that we have not moved away from any commitment around domestic violence leave. we heard from ms veronica black, the national coordinator organising and development of the fsu—the finance sector union of australia—who talked about the incredible importance of women being able to maintain economic independence in order to give them the best chance of being able to escape from a violent situation.",1
198,Australian Bar Association," human rights and legal organisations, including the australian bar association, the law council of australia, the united nations and other international human rights bodies, have come forward to defend the australian human rights commission and its president from these unprecedented attacks by this government and by the attorney-general. law experts have warned that these attacks jeopardise our democratic system. the australian bar association in january of this year expressed concerns that governments risk undermining public confidence in the independent courts, tribunals and commissions which protect and uphold the rule of law in australia. indeed, it is interesting to see that the chair of the australian bar association, mr mark livesey qc, stated—and this goes to the crux of this debate: we have the joint statement of the law council and the australian bar association in february of this year: that was signed by fiona mcleod, senior counsel and president of the australian bar association, and mr duncan mcconnel, president of the law council. they point out that professor triggs has a distinguished career in law and is highly respected. as i said earlier, mark livesey, of the australian bar association, said it is not the role of the commission or a court to decide how odious or worthy a person is. a person in australia has human rights and has a right to have those human rights upheld. if we start to pick and choose as to who is worthy of having human rights—indivisible, universal human rights—we are running down a very risky, slippery slide.",3

1254,Medecins Sans Frontieres," as it stands, the involvement of the office of the high commissioner for human rights occurs by deployment of personnel from bangkok when it would be far preferable if that office could maintain an appropriately resourced presence in burma itself. similarly, the banning of medecins sans frontieres, or doctors without borders, from operating in rakhine state is unacceptable and must be protested at the highest level. medecins sans frontieres has been the principal provider of health care in rakhine, operating nine clinics in towns across the state, but it was ordered by the burmese government to cease providing this critical function on the grounds of alleged impartiality shown towards the rohingya. the real reason may be that msf has been prepared to report accurately on atrocities committed against the rohingya, such as the incident at maungdaw earlier this year, where 48 villagers were killed.",1

892,Conservation Volunteers Australia," in developing this bill we have consulted broadly with the national farmers' federation, the australian conservation foundation, the world wildlife fund, greening australia, conservation volunteers australia and landcare networks as well as having comprehensive consultation with the department of agriculture. this bill will deliver for agriculture and balance the needs of our farmers with the responsibilities we have to the environment. at the heart of the coalition government's mission to build a strong and prosperous economy for a safe and secure australia is less regulation for our agricultural sector. for too long, more regulation has been the default option for policymakers. during the previous government more than 21,000 new regulations found their way into national life, with poorly designed and inefficient regulation imposing unnecessary costs on each and every australian. this is true of their approach to agriculture, a sector they lack the capacity to understand.",4
1010,Family First,"this bill is another example of the suite of opportunistic and ad hoc electoral changes put forward by labor, this time in cahoots with the greens. the coalition has always believed that any proposals for electoral reform should be part of a comprehensive package, not released in dribs and drabs. we said that a comprehensive bill should be brought in after the green paper process was completed and the government had issued its response. yet we have seen seven bills on electoral matters before the house: the taxation laws amendment bill, two earlier iterations of the same bill before us today and four other electoral bills dealt with in june. at the core of the current bill is a cynical attempt to seek partisan gain under the guise of reform. the bill is a deliberate attempt to advantage the labor party and the greens and to entrench that financial advantage. it will disadvantage permanently the coalition, the independents and the smaller parties like family first. so once again i say: we opposed the previous bills and we will continue to oppose this bill. so let us put it in perspective. i have been made aware of a leaked financial statement of the new south wales branch of the amwu from 2008. on page 3 of that document, under the heading 'national council political fund', i note the following items: affiliation fees, $401,846—and i would hazard a guess it was not affiliated with the liberal party, the greens, family first or independents; donations, $209,591—and i would also guess that this was not a donation to the liberal party, the greens, family first or independents; election advertising, $8,120. this brings the total for one year of overt political expenditure to over $620,000. but the best is the last. there is a specific line item in these accounts which says, 'marginal seat campaign: $150,352.' and that is just one branch of one union and the influence that comes their way.",1
1213,Knights of the Southern Cross," dinny was involved in community and sporting groups. a local commented, 'dinny can go from one meeting to the another, change hats and make a worthy contribution to the next.' some of those activities included junior farmers, tennis club, the football club and eastern districts football league, the bush fire brigade, the hall committee st mary's catholic church, the knights of the southern cross, school organisations, wa farmers, the western australian and federal pork industry advisory councils, the merredin repertory club and the merredin civic bowling club. dinny was a merredin shire councillor for 12 years. there was the merrittville retirement village, beringa frail aged hostel and permanent care nursing home, the merredin senior centre and the men's shed.",1

1116,Harness Racing Australia," i will not go over the excellent contribution of senator colbeck with regard to the levy, except to say that the levy is set at zero until or unless we get—and hopefully we never do—one of these exotic diseases which has to be eradicated. yes, it was eventually decided after a lot of consultation that such a levy would go on concentrated feeds and wormers. in the few moments available to me, i want to recognise, firstly, the excellent work undertaken by animal health australia, particularly its chief executive, dr michael bond. it is that organisation that has responsibility for emergency animal disease responses in all of the other animal species, and the work done by dr mike bond is complementary and should be recognised. i also want to recognise—i think almost for the first time in my 35 or 40 years of involvement with the horse industry—the goodwill that actually did come out of the whole exercise eventually. the australian racing thoroughbred industry was represented by the australian racing board. the harness racing industry, both the breeding and the racing sides, was represented by harness racing australia. i particularly give credit to the work undertaken by the officials of that organisation. equestrian australia was a signatory to the eadra on behalf of the performance horse industry, and it fell to the australian horse industry council to represent all of the other horse breeds. ",4
1482,Red Meat Advisory Council," the government recognises this may take some time and will work with industry on appropriate transition funding through existing mechanisms, such as the red meat advisory council fund. an important part of that will be the continued support of existing members of the cattle council of australia until the new representative body agreed to by industry has completed its first annual general meeting. the committee recommends that the minister for agriculture dissolve the red meat advisory council. the committee further recommends that the minister for agriculture establish a new system to manage and disperse earnings from the red meat industry reserve fund, in consultation with the industry. the government does agree that improvements can be made to the efficacy of the red meat advisory council in terms of the delivery of its core mission and therefore notes the most beneficial course of action is to work with the organisation to make it more transparent and accountable to address the concerns raised in the inquiry.",4
795,Bush Heritage Australia," bush heritage australia observes in relation this bill that there is no recognition of the valuable environmental assets and capital in the woomera prohibited area. it protects significant extents of intact, healthy vegetation and relatively healthy populations of native animals. there is a need to protect this largely intact area for the long-term health of the region's biodiversity and human population. bush heritage australia recommend that the area's biodiversity, cultural and landscape assets should be formally recognised in the bill.",3
578,Australian Press Council," two past chairs and the current chair of the australian press council told the finkelstein inquiry there were flaws in the operation, funding and independence of the australian press council. this is not the government; these are the people who run the australian press council. the australian press council said in its submission that publishers could withdraw at any time without adverse consequences, raising the point that publishers would not lose privacy protections if they withdrew. this is something the apc raised at the inquiry. then you have the contribution from the former chair, ken mckinnon. he has raised concerns about the council's independence, saying that proprietors who support the press council are equally interested in influencing its actions. he told the inquiry that an editor once said to him: 'if you promise not to uphold any complaints from my paper we will double our subscription, is that a deal?' how is that independence? how is that good governance?",3
245,Australian Christian Lobby," (pearce) (10:34): from the outset i acknowledge the excellent work by the chair of the standing committee on social policy and legal affairs, the member for moreton, in the conduct of this inquiry and by my colleagues on this committee. in its submission to the inquiry into the regulation of billboard and outdoor advert­ising, the australian christian lobby clearly summed up why this inquiry is important. as the member for moreton has quite rightly said, this notion had widespread acceptance in the many submissions that were made to the committee on this topic. the australian christian lobby stated:",3

263,Australian Communications Consumer Action Network," i have some fantastic broadband advocacy groups in my local area. i work a lot with the australian communications consumer action network—accan, as it is commonly known. they have also raised some serious concerns about consumer detriment in the report, which is the basis for legislation that is now before the house, but the government ignored those concerns in the majority report of the senate environment and communications legislation committee. it recommended, in that majority report of the review of the legislation, that the bill be passed without amendment. this week, however, the government has been forced into what could only be described as a very humiliating backdown on the bill. the amendments to be introduced by the government follow, to the letter, labor's recommendations in its dissenting report to the committee. we are glad that they have, finally, heeded the recommendations of industry and are bedding down those recommendations that were put forward.",3
1275,Minerals Council of Australia," the mrrt is a tax that the government designed in close consultation with the mining companies that will be most affected by it. it is designed to be more efficient for the companies and fairer for the australian people, who should benefit from the mineral wealth of the country. the mining sector sees that. following the announcement of the mrrt on 2 july 2010, the minerals council of australia said:",3
1519,Rural Doctors Association of Australia," so what is next? mr hockey has been reported as saying the government listened to the medical community and is going to continue to work closely with the medical community. the rural doctors association of australia has certainly welcomed this latest backflip by the government. but it is also saying that it has major concerns about the government's current commitment to maintain the freeze on the indexation of medicare rebates paid to patients. so what the rdaa is saying is that this big freeze has the potential to increase costs for patients to a greater extent than the proposed co-payment, with the resultant restriction and difficulties in accessing primary care services. so here we are again with a policy that is designed to attack the primary level of health care. the primary purpose for people to go to the doctor is to try and get their health in order before it gets to a stage when they are really sick. so it is a pity that the government had not bothered to listen before putting of these ill-thought-through policies out into the community.",3

1357,National Rugby League," (flynn) (13:51): the communities of central queensland from bundaberg to mackay and west to the border are united in a bid for a national rugby league team. this is the heartland of rugby league—just look at the players produced from this area, past, present and future. the crop of juniors coming through is excellent. not only are the nrl 'fanatics' of the region keen to see central queensland represented in a national competition but business and community leaders are encouraging the bid to promote the central queensland region as an economic powerhouse, sustaining the most exciting and liveable region in australia.

1034,Financial Counselling Australia," there are alternatives out there, and these are the options that should be promoted and supported for people to use. consumer advocates such as the consumer action law centre and financial counsellors, including their peak organisation, financial counselling australia, have regularly reported that significant numbers of people are coming to them in financial stress as a result of entering into consumer leases using centrepay.",3
881,Community Housing Federation of Australia," there are a couple of witnesses who i would also like to specifically acknowledge. can you imagine being called before a senate inquiry into an issue that affects as many people as housing affordability does, just after you had had your funding cut, and asked to provide the kind of essential advice and advocacy that you had been doing on a shoestring of a budget. so i particularly acknowledge carol croce and eddy bourke from the community housing federation of australia, adrian pisarski and all those at national shelter, and glenda and her wonderful staff at homelessness australia. these are the most eminent experts and compassionate problem-solvers in the country in their field, and they were giving us evidence on what the consequences would be, as senator mclucas identified in her contribution, of axing their funding. mr hockey, having introduced his task force after fobbing the entire country off for more than a year on this inquiry that the federal government was meant to be undertaking, has then shoved it under the rug of the tax white paper and the reform of the federation. it is as though nobody is going to lift a finger to help people who are homeless or who are suffering skyrocketing rents and basically a generation that has given up on ever being able to own their own home unless we sell a century's worth of disputes over the function and form of the federation. we had what i thought were constructive contributions from everybody, including coalition senators. while collectively we bring very different perspectives to bear, at least the quality of debate and questions that were put to witnesses were very high. it was extremely disappointing to then see the government minority report effectively dismissing out of hand three-quarters of the recommendations on the basis that it is red tape. if you are so keen on operating the commonwealth of australia as though it is a corporation—effectively just sacking people and abolishing things—then go back to the private sector. government is actually necessary for some things, and it would be very cold comfort for those homeless people in our community who are forced to go through another winter with nothing on the table.",3
749,Basketball Australia," basketball australia and the coach of the australian opals have told me that our current wnbl is the third best in the world and that opportunities for women to play in their home country at an elite level help to build the opals. the loss of the wnbl would not only be a problem for fielding a strong opals team; it would be a loss of really positive role models for young women. at a recent bendigo spirit match, i spoke to a father who said that, just as he likes to sit and watch football with his young son, he likes to sit and watch basketball with his young daughter. to me, that speaks to the problem of these funding cuts and how, again, for such a small amount of money, the government is missing the broader responsibility of equity and ensuring that women can continue to have the same opportunities as men when it comes to elite sport.",3
563,Australian Physiotherapy Association," there are consequences of the decision that the government is making. many of my colleagues have talked about the decline that modelling shows will occur. government figures show that currently some 5.6 million australians are privately insured. the deloitte report indicates that some 1.6 million will withdraw from their private hospital cover over a five-year period and 4.3 million will downgrade to lower levels of cover. the most important thing to look at, though, is what is going to happen in the area of allied health, or the extras cover. the australian physiotherapy association said in one of their submissions that they were alarmed at the lack of consideration of ancillary cover in the treasurer's analysis. they are alarmed for very good reason. for those with extras cover the impact is expected to be greater—nearly one in five, or 18 per cent, will drop their extras altogether, with a further one in three, or 34 per cent, likely to downgrade. putting the two groups together—those who drop the cover altogether and those who downgrade the extras—shows some 52 per cent will potentially cut back on extras cover, things like dental, optical, physiotherapy, podiatry et cetera.",3
1057,Free TV Australia," in the words of harold mitchell of free tv australia: this is the bill we have before us. it is opposed by free tv australia, the commercial networks and foxtel. as has been pointed out—even though reputable organisations like fecca note in their submission that it is something that is going to happen—they are doing this very clearly through gritted teeth. you only have to look at the transcript from the senate environment and communications legislation committee, which, in fact, is not due to report until 29 may. so tonight we are debating and will divide on this bill for which a parliamentary inquiry in the other place is still occurring and for which an extension of time has been granted until 29 may to report.",3

354,Australian Food and Grocery Council," (north sydney) (15:04): i second the motion to suspend standing and sessional orders. this matter is urgent, because the government is refusing to answer the most basic questions in this place about the carbon tax. the government is refusing to answer a question about how many jobs will be affected. the government is refusing to answer a question about the impact on the economy. the government is refusing to answer a simple question about the impact on households. the government is refusing to answer a simple question about what the price will be, leaving the vacuum to be filled by the greens, who range between $40 a tonne and $100 a tonne. the government is refusing to answer questions about the impact of other trading partners, such as russia and canada, declaring that they will not have a second round of the kyoto protocol. the government is refusing to answer a question about whether it is modelling the impact of our trading partners pulling out over the weekend from that commitment. the government is refusing to respond to the modelling of the australian food and grocery council which suggests that food and grocery prices will rise by between three and five per cent at $26 a tonne.",3
237,Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry,"the coalition believes that the government expenditure incurred to establish the centrelink administered ppl system should continue to deliver benefits to the australian community well beyond the six-month shelf life the gillard government has arbitrarily determined. it is not surprising that there has been such an outcry against the gillard labor government's demand that employers, both big and small, relieve the government and centrelink of their responsibility to administer the paid parental leave system. the australian chamber of commerce and industry's 12 october 2010 media statement captured the key concerns with the government's approach. acci chief executive, peter anderson, said:",3
1371,National Union of Workers,"the involvement of victorian government minister martin pakula, a former victorian secretary of the national union of workers, in directing traffic to the victorian trades hall council secretary and former blf official brian boyd to negotiate industrial agreements for the desalination plant is victoria's worst kept secret. the story is that the interests of victorian taxpayers were ransomed as part of an internal alp deal to satisfy a bizarre political alliance between the cfmeu, the national union of workers and the shop assistants union. observers do not think it a coincidence that martin pakula announced that thiess was awarded the desalination plant tender within days of the finalisation of preselections within the labor party for the elections this saturday. it is extraordinary that, while john brumby talks tough when it comes to law and order, he has never publicly criticised the cfmeu, even when that union was bringing in bikie gangs as picketers at the west gate bridge project. presumably mr brumby's and the labor government's silence when it comes to the thuggery of the victorian branch of the cfmeu is as much a mystery to the prime minister as it is to observers of the victoria's industrial scene. on this issue, credit must be given to the prime minister. she should be given credit for standing up to a powerful left-wing union by making clear that she will not support or condone, either actively or by her silence, union thuggery, while the so-called right-wing victorian premier sits on his hands. but then maybe it should not come as a surprise. the prime minister would have as much understanding as most of how victoria's so-called right-wing premier is beholden to this bizarre alliance between the national union of workers, the shop assistants union and the cfmeu.",1
958,Disability Services Australia," i will now briefly turn to the recent disability efforts by a variety of groups in my electorate, including the share care centre, northcott disability services, the australian foundation for disabilities and the macarthur community representatives network. all of these actively campaign for national insurance with regard to disabilities. i was approached by and interviewed sherie avalos, the ceo of share care and a former disability services australia and macarthur disability services employee. i am impressed by the efforts of parents, carers, community organisations et cetera in the campbelltown-macarthur region. i have to say that, having represented reid for 20 years, the level of activity on these issues was nothing like i have witnessed over the period that i have represented werriwa. whether it is because of the presence of housing department properties or an inclination by some communities to be more open in their discussion of these problems, campbelltown, werriwa, macarthur et cetera are characterised by incredible activity on this issue. constituents would be pleased that the current government has reversed the liberal party's record of disability cutbacks and funding freezes. they would be keen to note that the current government has brought in the $7.6 billion national disability agreement and that it has in recent days announced its support for national insurance in this field.",1
1213,Knights of the Southern Cross," i make that point because of the observations made by my senate colleagues on the circumstance of the right of religious organisations. my mother then spent time, from february 2002 until 4 february 2012, in the southern cross care facility of margaret hubery house in perth, run by the knights of the southern cross—a catholic aged-care institution. if senator boyce were here, i would say to her that, in the entire time that i had responsibility as the primary carer for my mother while she was in that facility and as a person who engaged actively with the management of the margaret hubery facility and southern cross care homes, i never at any time saw a circumstance of discrimination against any resident. there was a wide range of residents. there were aged sisters and aged brothers and priests. there were people of every or no denomination. it was not my business to inquire into their gender identity, sexual orientation or intersex status, if they had one, but i can say that at no time have i ever observed any discrimination of any type. i believe, as has been said here this evening, that you cannot have freedom of religion if you turn around and have legislation which imposes on a church or a religious institution something that is at variance with its very tenets or rules. if there is a fault with those, it should be examined. it is dangerous to say that, simply because there is commonwealth government support for an organisation, such as the religious organisation in the case i referred to, the knights of the southern cross, you can at the stroke of a pen remove the independence and capacity of that religious organisation to preserve and respect the tenets upon which it was based. i would argue that very, very actively. it is not up to the state to tell churches what they can or cannot believe.",2
474,Australian Local Government Association," in september 2011 coag established the standing council on transport and infrastructure (scoti). members of scott are commonwealth, state, territory and new zealand ministers with responsibility for transport and infrastructure issues, and a representative, at councillor level, of the australian local government association. the council pursues and monitors issues of national significance which require sustained, collaborative effort in the areas of transport, logistics and infrastructure. an example of this is the recent completion of the national land freight strategy.",4
1283,Motor Neurone Disease Australia," (tasmania—deputy opposition whip in the senate) (22:16): earlier this month, alongside my sister jan robinson, i joined the ranks of millions worldwide who have undertaken the ice bucket challenge. as everyone in this place would know, the ice bucket challenge is an awareness and fundraising campaign. it sprouted in the united states as a campaign to raise funds for als, or motor neurone disease as it is referred to in australia. in only a few short months it has become a global phenomenon that has attracted the support of cultural luminaries like oprah winfrey, bill gates and britney spears. even homer simpson took a break from his busy 2d life to take part. for my part, i contributed $100 toward motor neurone disease australia. i nominated that the money should go directly to the organisation's research arm, the motor neurone disease research institute of australia, to help fund research efforts to fight this debilitating disease. the day raised over $600 for motor neurone disease australia—a great effort. if the ice bucket challenge can bring us even an inch closer to a treatment or a cure of this cruel disease for people like barry and his family, then i am proud to have taken part. of course, there will always be doubters. recently there has been a rash of criticism about the ice bucket challenge. many have said that the message of motor neurone disease is getting obscured in a cloud of celebrity, stunts and selfies. while there may be an element of truth in this, it is impossible to ignore the incredible achievements of the challenge in raising funds for research and support for families living with this death sentence. it may be the most successful global fundraising effort the world has yet seen—and we cannot deny the outstanding results. firstly, the influx of financial support for motor neurone support organisations has been simply massive. in the united states, the als association recently reported additional funding of more than $110 million from three million donors in america. this is particularly remarkable when you consider that in a similar period last year the organisation had only received $2.8 million. the money will support the association's research, care services and public policy initiatives. back home in australia, motor neurone disease australia has received $2 million from 47,000 australian supporters. this is a massive 15-fold increase in the amount of money they would normally have expected to raise. the influx of funds has allowed motor neurone disease australia to initiate an ice bucket challenge research grant which will start in 2015. there is no doubt that if the ice bucket challenge was not around this would not have been possible. and across the world, the money is still pouring in. the cause of the degeneration in motor neurone disease is still a great mystery, but this global fundraising boost will make a huge difference to the research capacity.",1
916,Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia," jaye retired from the wa parliament in 2008; however, the legacy of her service does not end there. she went on to become the chief executive officer of the council of small business organisations of australia, cosboa, a position in which she forged strong ties between government and business during the height of the global financial crisis. in their vale for jaye, the council of small business organisations honoured her in much the same way that i have. they paid tribute to a woman who was 'a passionate and talented advocate for the small business community'. while this vale cannot even begin to sketch out the extraordinary achievements that jaye had in her life, i hope it goes some way to communicating the respect and admiration that people had for her in the community, public and private sectors.",1
1514,Royal Institute for Deaf and Blind Children,"—it is my privilege to rise today to congratulate john berryman, the ceo of the royal institute for deaf and blind children at north rocks, in my electorate of mitchell. after 33 years of service with the royal institute for deaf and blind children he is retiring. in 1978 john berryman was hired to install the first computer at the royal institute for deaf and blind children. this fine charity is one of australia's oldest registered charities and this year is celebrating its 150-year anniversary. that is a fantastic achievement in anyone's books. they have been providing services for blind and deaf children for 150 years, and with advances in technology the impact that they have had on children across this nation has been immense. they have early intervention, preschool and school programs. their programs for deaf and hearing impaired children are built on spoken communications and involve the use of cochlear implants and high-quality hearing aids. they conduct programs for smaller groups of deaf children who need to use sign language. when you visit their campus it is amazing to see the technology that is being used for video conferencing, serving the country and regional areas of our nation. it is a fine facility. i want to congratulate john berryman on 33 wonderful years and congratulate the royal institute for deaf and blind children at north rocks for the institution it has become today.

198,Australian Bar Association," during the inquiry the committee heard concerns that the convention does not contain sufficiently robust privacy and civil liberties protections to offset its increased surveillance and information-sharing powers. the law council, the australian bar association and several other submitters expressed concerns relating to the threshold for granting a stored communication warrant, to privacy safeguards and to conditions of disclosure. the bill in its current form lowers the justification threshold for foreign countries, and this was something that did concern several of the submitters to the inquiry. there is no requirement that a foreign country justify the use of stored communications. the law council expressed the view that foreign agencies should be required to provide sufficient information on the merits of the request, but i note that the european convention contains express limitations and assumptions that limit the scope of procedural powers by requiring that such powers be for the purpose of specific criminal investigations and proceedings.
